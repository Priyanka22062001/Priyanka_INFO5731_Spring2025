However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.\\n\\nAs far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.\\n\\nThe characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.\\n\\nOverall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.\\n\\nAs of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip.\",\n          \"I really enjoyed this movie. Plot, cast, production... everything is on point. If you haven't seen The Dark Knight, you should. Some say its overrated.. no its not! It deserves its rating and its rank in the top rated IMDB movies of all time.\",\n          \"All you need to do is switch this film on for 30 seconds, and your hooked.

Use registered public SSH key(s) By default anybody can connect to the upterm session. You can opt-in to install the public SSH keys that you have registered with your GitHub profile. name: CI on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@v2     - name: Setup upterm session       uses: lhotari/action-upterm@v1       with:         ## limits ssh access and adds the ssh public key for the user which triggered the workflow         limit-access-to-actor: true         ## limits ssh access and adds the ssh public keys of the listed GitHub users         limit-access-to-users: githubuser1,githubuser2 If the registered public SSH key is not your default private SSH key, you will need to specify the path manually, like so: ssh -i <path-to-key> <upterm-connection-string>. Use custom upterm server Follow instructions to deploy Upterm server to Heroku. There are also other deployment options available. You can configure the Upterm server with the upterm-server input parameter, for example: name: CI on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@v2     - name: Setup upterm session       uses: lhotari/action-upterm@v1       with:         ## limits ssh access and adds the ssh public key for the user which triggered the workflow         limit-access-to-actor: true         ## Use the Heroku deployed Uptermd server via Websocket         upterm-server: wss://YOUR_HEROKU_APP_URL Shut down server if user doesn't connect If you'd like to shut down the server after a certain number of minutes if no user connects, use the wait-timeout-minutes input parameter. This can be useful for using action-upterm to get a debug shell if your job fails, but not have the debug shell keep your pipeline running for too long if no one is interested in debugging it. name: CI on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@v2     - name: Setup upterm session       uses: lhotari/action-upterm@v1       if: ${{ failure() }}       with:         ## If no one connects after 5 minutes, shut down server.         wait-timeout-minutes: 5 Continue a workflow If you want to continue a workflow and you are inside a upterm session, just create a empty file with the name continue either in the root directory or in the workspace directory by running touch continue or sudo touch /continue. Closing the terminal will also continue the workflow. However you won't be able to reconnect in that case. It's possible to detach from the terminal and not continue by first pressing C-b and then d (tmux detach command keys).

Usage To run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 After the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard run step: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 6.0.2 A specific Swift version can be set using the swift-version input: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: \\\"5.1.0\\\" - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0 Works perfect together with matrixes: name: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy:   matrix:     os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]     swift: [\\\"5.4.3\\\", \\\"5.2.4\\\"] steps: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }} - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version Note about versions This project uses strict semantic versioning to determine what version of Swift to configure. This differs slightly from the official convention used by Swift. For example, Swift is available as version 5.1 but using this as value for swift-version will be interpreted as a version range of 5.1.X where X is the latest patch version available for that major and minor version. In other words specifying... \\\"5.1.0\\\" will resolve to version 5.1 \\\"5.1\\\" will resolve to latest patch version (aka 5.1.1) \\\"5\\\" will resolve to latest minor and patch version (aka 5.10) Caveats YAML interprets eg. 5.0 as a float, this action will then interpret that as 5 which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: '5.0' Not: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: 5.0 Keeping the action up-to-date You have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like v2.0.1) or use the major version tag (like v2). Specific version We recommend using the specific version tag together with Dependabot to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot. Major version tag If you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.

Overview cargo-multivers builds multiple versions of the binary of a Rust package. Each version is built with a set of CPU features (e.g., +cmpxchg16b,+fxsr,+sse,+sse2,+sse3) from a CPU (e.g., ivybridge) supported by the target (e.g., x86_64-pc-windows-msvc). By default, it lists the CPUs known to rustc for a given target, then it fetches each set of CPU features and filters out the duplicates (i.e., the CPUs that support the same extensions). On x86_64, by default, it limits the CPUs to the four microarchitecture levels (x86-64,x86-64-v2,x86-64-v3,x86-64-v4) to limit the build time. But, you can define a section in your Cargo.toml to set the allowed list of CPUs for your package. For example, for x86_64 you could add: [package.metadata.multivers.x86_64] cpus = [\\\"x86-64\\\", \\\"x86-64-v2\\\", \\\"x86-64-v3\\\", \\\"x86-64-v4\\\", \\\"raptorlake\\\"] After building the different versions, it computes a hash of each version and it filters out the duplicates (i.e., the compilations that gave the same binaries despite having different CPU features). Finally, it builds a runner that embeds one version compressed (the source) and the others as compressed binary patches to the source. For instance, when building for the target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, by default 4 different versions will be built, filtered, compressed, and merged into a single portable binary. When executed, the runner uncompresses and executes the version that matches the CPU features of the host. Intended Use While cargo-multivers could be used to build any kind of binary from a Rust package, it is mostly intended for the following use cases: To build a project that is distributed to multiple users with different microarchitectures (e.g., a release version of your project). To build a program that performs long running tasks (e.g., heavy computations, a server, or a game). Tip If you only want to optimize your program for your CPU, do not use cargo multivers, you can just use -C target-cpu=native like this: RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-cpu=native cargo build --release. You will save some CPU cycles :) Installation cargo install --locked cargo-multivers Usage cargo +nightly multivers Supported Operating Systems This project is tested on Windows and Linux (due to the use of memfd_create, only Linux >= v3.17 is supported). Supported Architectures In theory the following architectures are supported: x86, x86_64, arm, aarch64, riscv32, riscv64, powerpc, powerpc64, mips, and mips64. But only x86_64 is tested. Default CPU List To limit build time, cargo multivers defines by default for some architectures a limited number of CPUs to build with. Architecture CPUs x86_64 x86-64,x86-64-v2,x86-64-v3,x86-64-v4 * All You can override this with either the --cpus option on the command line, or by defining a key in your Cargo.toml: [package.metadata.multivers.ARCHITECTURE_NAME] cpus = [\\\"...\\\", \\\"...\\\"] Recommendations cargo multivers uses the release profile of your package to build the binary ([profile.release]). To optimize the size of your binary and to reduce the startup time, it is recommended to enable features that can reduce the size of each build. For example, you can have the following profile that reduce the size of your binary, while not increasing significantly the build time: [profile.release] strip = \\\"symbols\\\" panic = \\\"abort\\\" lto = \\\"thin\\\" GitHub Actions Integration If you want to publish an optimized portable binary built by cargo-multivers when releasing a new version of your project, you can use the cargo-multivers GitHub Action. To do that you need to have a Rust nightly toolchain and add a step to your job:     - uses: ronnychevalier/cargo-multivers@main For example, this can look like: jobs:   cargo-multivers-build:     name: Build with cargo-multivers     runs-on: windows-latest     steps:     - name: Checkout repository       uses: actions/checkout@v4     - name: Install Rust nightly       uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@master       with:         toolchain: nightly     - uses: ronnychevalier/cargo-multivers@main       with:         manifest_path: path/to-your/Cargo.toml     - name: Upload release archive       uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1       if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')       with:         files: the-name-of-your-binary.exe          ... [other config fields] Inputs You can set two types of inputs. The ones that are related to how cargo-multivers is installed: Name Description Required Default version Version of cargo-multivers to use (e.g., 0.7.0) false Latest published version on crates.io And the ones that are related to the arguments given to cargo multivers (e.g., target configures the --target option): Name Description Required Default manifest_path Path to Cargo.toml false target Build for the target triple false out_dir Copy final artifacts to this directory true . profile Build artifacts with the specified profile false runner_version Specify the version of the runner to use false other_args Other arguments given to cargo multivers false build_args Arguments given to cargo build false Related Work If you want to apply this approach only at the function level, take a look at the multiversion crate. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-cookbook/top/methodologies/compile-portable-optimized-binary.html License Licensed under either of Apache License, Version 2.0, (LICENSE-APACHE or https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) MIT license (LICENSE-MIT or https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) at your option.

You can opt-in to install the public SSH keys that you have registered with your GitHub profile. name: CI on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@v2     - name: Setup upterm session       uses: lhotari/action-upterm@v1       with:         ## limits ssh access and adds the ssh public key for the user which triggered the workflow         limit-access-to-actor: true         ## limits ssh access and adds the ssh public keys of the listed GitHub users         limit-access-to-users: githubuser1,githubuser2 If the registered public SSH key is not your default private SSH key, you will need to specify the path manually, like so: ssh -i <path-to-key> <upterm-connection-string>. Use custom upterm server Follow instructions to deploy Upterm server to Heroku. There are also other deployment options available. You can configure the Upterm server with the upterm-server input parameter, for example: name: CI on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@v2     - name: Setup upterm session       uses: lhotari/action-upterm@v1       with:         ## limits ssh access and adds the ssh public key for the user which triggered the workflow         limit-access-to-actor: true         ## Use the Heroku deployed Uptermd server via Websocket         upterm-server: wss://YOUR_HEROKU_APP_URL Shut down server if user doesn't connect If you'd like to shut down the server after a certain number of minutes if no user connects, use the wait-timeout-minutes input parameter. This can be useful for using action-upterm to get a debug shell if your job fails, but not have the debug shell keep your pipeline running for too long if no one is interested in debugging it. name: CI on: [push] jobs:   build:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:     - uses: actions/checkout@v2     - name: Setup upterm session       uses: lhotari/action-upterm@v1       if: ${{ failure() }}       with:         ## If no one connects after 5 minutes, shut down server.         wait-timeout-minutes: 5 Continue a workflow If you want to continue a workflow and you are inside a upterm session, just create a empty file with the name continue either in the root directory or in the workspace directory by running touch continue or sudo touch /continue. Closing the terminal will also continue the workflow. However you won't be able to reconnect in that case. It's possible to detach from the terminal and not continue by first pressing C-b and then d (tmux detach command keys).

Usage To run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 After the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard run step: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2 - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 6.0.2 A specific Swift version can be set using the swift-version input: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: \\\"5.1.0\\\" - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0 Works perfect together with matrixes: name: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }} runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} strategy:   matrix:     os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]     swift: [\\\"5.4.3\\\", \\\"5.2.4\\\"] steps: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }} - name: Get swift version   run: swift --version Note about versions This project uses strict semantic versioning to determine what version of Swift to configure. This differs slightly from the official convention used by Swift. For example, Swift is available as version 5.1 but using this as value for swift-version will be interpreted as a version range of 5.1.X where X is the latest patch version available for that major and minor version. In other words specifying... \\\"5.1.0\\\" will resolve to version 5.1 \\\"5.1\\\" will resolve to latest patch version (aka 5.1.1) \\\"5\\\" will resolve to latest minor and patch version (aka 5.10) Caveats YAML interprets eg. 5.0 as a float, this action will then interpret that as 5 which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: '5.0' Not: - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2   with:     swift-version: 5.0 Keeping the action up-to-date You have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like v2.0.1) or use the major version tag (like v2). Specific version We recommend using the specific version tag together with Dependabot to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot. Major version tag If you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.

Overview cargo-multivers builds multiple versions of the binary of a Rust package. Each version is built with a set of CPU features (e.g., +cmpxchg16b,+fxsr,+sse,+sse2,+sse3) from a CPU (e.g., ivybridge) supported by the target (e.g., x86_64-pc-windows-msvc). By default, it lists the CPUs known to rustc for a given target, then it fetches each set of CPU features and filters out the duplicates (i.e., the CPUs that support the same extensions). On x86_64, by default, it limits the CPUs to the four microarchitecture levels (x86-64,x86-64-v2,x86-64-v3,x86-64-v4) to limit the build time. But, you can define a section in your Cargo.toml to set the allowed list of CPUs for your package. For example, for x86_64 you could add: [package.metadata.multivers.x86_64] cpus = [\\\"x86-64\\\", \\\"x86-64-v2\\\", \\\"x86-64-v3\\\", \\\"x86-64-v4\\\", \\\"raptorlake\\\"] After building the different versions, it computes a hash of each version and it filters out the duplicates (i.e., the compilations that gave the same binaries despite having different CPU features). Finally, it builds a runner that embeds one version compressed (the source) and the others as compressed binary patches to the source. For instance, when building for the target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, by default 4 different versions will be built, filtered, compressed, and merged into a single portable binary. When executed, the runner uncompresses and executes the version that matches the CPU features of the host. Intended Use While cargo-multivers could be used to build any kind of binary from a Rust package, it is mostly intended for the following use cases: To build a project that is distributed to multiple users with different microarchitectures (e.g., a release version of your project). To build a program that performs long running tasks (e.g., heavy computations, a server, or a game). Tip If you only want to optimize your program for your CPU, do not use cargo multivers, you can just use -C target-cpu=native like this: RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-cpu=native cargo build --release. You will save some CPU cycles :) Installation cargo install --locked cargo-multivers Usage cargo +nightly multivers Supported Operating Systems This project is tested on Windows and Linux (due to the use of memfd_create, only Linux >= v3.17 is supported). Supported Architectures In theory the following architectures are supported: x86, x86_64, arm, aarch64, riscv32, riscv64, powerpc, powerpc64, mips, and mips64. But only x86_64 is tested. Default CPU List To limit build time, cargo multivers defines by default for some architectures a limited number of CPUs to build with. Architecture CPUs x86_64 x86-64,x86-64-v2,x86-64-v3,x86-64-v4 * All You can override this with either the --cpus option on the command line, or by defining a key in your Cargo.toml: [package.metadata.multivers.ARCHITECTURE_NAME] cpus = [\\\"...\\\", \\\"...\\\"] Recommendations cargo multivers uses the release profile of your package to build the binary ([profile.release]). To optimize the size of your binary and to reduce the startup time, it is recommended to enable features that can reduce the size of each build. For example, you can have the following profile that reduce the size of your binary, while not increasing significantly the build time: [profile.release] strip = \\\"symbols\\\" panic = \\\"abort\\\" lto = \\\"thin\\\" GitHub Actions Integration If you want to publish an optimized portable binary built by cargo-multivers when releasing a new version of your project, you can use the cargo-multivers GitHub Action. To do that you need to have a Rust nightly toolchain and add a step to your job:     - uses: ronnychevalier/cargo-multivers@main For example, this can look like: jobs:   cargo-multivers-build:     name: Build with cargo-multivers     runs-on: windows-latest     steps:     - name: Checkout repository       uses: actions/checkout@v4     - name: Install Rust nightly       uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@master       with:         toolchain: nightly     - uses: ronnychevalier/cargo-multivers@main       with:         manifest_path: path/to-your/Cargo.toml     - name: Upload release archive       uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1       if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')       with:         files: the-name-of-your-binary.exe          ... [other config fields] Inputs You can set two types of inputs. The ones that are related to how cargo-multivers is installed: Name Description Required Default version Version of cargo-multivers to use (e.g., 0.7.0) false Latest published version on crates.io And the ones that are related to the arguments given to cargo multivers (e.g., target configures the --target option): Name Description Required Default manifest_path Path to Cargo.toml false target Build for the target triple false out_dir Copy final artifacts to this directory true . profile Build artifacts with the specified profile false runner_version Specify the version of the runner to use false other_args Other arguments given to cargo multivers false build_args Arguments given to cargo build false Related Work If you want to apply this approach only at the function level, take a look at the multiversion crate. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/vtune-cookbook/top/methodologies/compile-portable-optimized-binary.html License Licensed under either of Apache License, Version 2.0, (LICENSE-APACHE or https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) MIT license (LICENSE-MIT or https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) at your option.

        "This assignment was both insightful and challenging. The most difficult part was handling large text data efficiently, especially with constituency and dependency parsing, which required significant computational resources. Troubleshooting missing NLP resources also took extra time. The retirement platform builds its structure with Java and Jakarta Multipart Parser and Apache Struts but must be carefully handled to avoid critical security threats. System integrity along with user data faces serious threats because of inappropriate access controls and file upload vulnerabilities with potential remote code execution. Security enhancements require implementation of Role-based access controls (RBAC) and file validation standards and use of current software patches along with alternative frameworks like Spring Boot."
