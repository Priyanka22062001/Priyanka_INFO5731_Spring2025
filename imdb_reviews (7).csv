review
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"

The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

10/10."
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

10/10."
"Its one od the best movies of decade,centuries and millenium! Its drama,Action,unexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable. I know you're saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS?"
"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

10/10 rating...well done"
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act. I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes it's villain who steal the show
"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10."
"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."
"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.
My go to movie on a Friday night! Excellent all around!
"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."
"I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for...."
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead)."
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Cinematic masterpiece with a solid 10/10 rating-this movie is truly exceptional. Christopher Nolan's genius shines through, as the film expertly navigates dark tones, immersing the audience in a gripping narrative. The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience, capturing every nuanced detail with precision. From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense, the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable. The actors' performances elevate the film to another level, delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll. In every aspect, this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right."
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

10/10."
"Its one od the best movies of decade,centuries and millenium! Its drama,Action,unexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable. I know you're saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS?"
"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

10/10 rating...well done"
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act. I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes it's villain who steal the show
"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10."
"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."
"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.
My go to movie on a Friday night! Excellent all around!
"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."
"I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for...."
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead)."
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Cinematic masterpiece with a solid 10/10 rating-this movie is truly exceptional. Christopher Nolan's genius shines through, as the film expertly navigates dark tones, immersing the audience in a gripping narrative. The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience, capturing every nuanced detail with precision. From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense, the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable. The actors' performances elevate the film to another level, delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll. In every aspect, this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right."
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie.
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time. Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling."
"This is one of the best movies which I have seen. One of the best movie in all terms. The best part was the villain's role, what a world class acting shown by the actor."
This movie will forever be my all time favorite! Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed.. but it was also released on my birthday! Best movie ever!
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic."
"Bale gud, Heath gud Affleck bad, Pattinson bad This Best movie ever. I rate 5/7.

My favourite hobby, watching this movie n playing Arkham games.

Did I mention bale Gud?"
"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

Rating - 9.6/10."
No one could create a unique Batman better than Nolan.
"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"
"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")"
"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."
"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?"
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

This movie made me tired."
"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up"
"Truly a movie that must be seen by all..I am a Batman fan,my favorite superhero,and Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knight,he did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight,he confirmed it..But to me,i really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledger's breathtaking performance here,i mean how can you not be blown away.?!I'm sorry to Jack Nicholson,he was still incredible in the original but Ledger,WOW..I have always been a fan of Ledger,seen pretty much all of his movies,and with this performance as The Joker,he needs to receive some kind of award,because (RIP) had he been alive,i can guarantee,he will be wanted by all movie directors/studios to be a star of their movies..So,I bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger/ The Joker.."
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

10/10."
"Its one od the best movies of decade,centuries and millenium! Its drama,Action,unexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable. I know you're saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS?"
"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!

The Dark Knight score: A + .

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

10/10 rating...well done"
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act. I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes it's villain who steal the show
"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10."
"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."
"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.
My go to movie on a Friday night! Excellent all around!
"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."
"I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for...."
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead)."
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Cinematic masterpiece with a solid 10/10 rating-this movie is truly exceptional. Christopher Nolan's genius shines through, as the film expertly navigates dark tones, immersing the audience in a gripping narrative. The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience, capturing every nuanced detail with precision. From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense, the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable. The actors' performances elevate the film to another level, delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll. In every aspect, this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right."
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie.
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time. Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling."
"This is one of the best movies which I have seen. One of the best movie in all terms. The best part was the villain's role, what a world class acting shown by the actor."
This movie will forever be my all time favorite! Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed.. but it was also released on my birthday! Best movie ever!
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic."
"Bale gud, Heath gud Affleck bad, Pattinson bad This Best movie ever. I rate 5/7.

My favourite hobby, watching this movie n playing Arkham games.

Did I mention bale Gud?"
"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

Rating - 9.6/10."
No one could create a unique Batman better than Nolan.
"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"
"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")"
"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."
"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?"
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

This movie made me tired."
"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up"
"Truly a movie that must be seen by all..I am a Batman fan,my favorite superhero,and Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knight,he did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight,he confirmed it..But to me,i really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledger's breathtaking performance here,i mean how can you not be blown away.?!I'm sorry to Jack Nicholson,he was still incredible in the original but Ledger,WOW..I have always been a fan of Ledger,seen pretty much all of his movies,and with this performance as The Joker,he needs to receive some kind of award,because (RIP) had he been alive,i can guarantee,he will be wanted by all movie directors/studios to be a star of their movies..So,I bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger/ The Joker.."
Excellent film and great performance by Heath Ledger
Awesome movie and fabulous acting of joker and batman
"It's the best superhero movie to date. Amazing casting, the cast played their parts with emotion. Great framing, lighting, suspense and just everything about this movie is amazing!"
Like I said The Dark Knight was the best movie I have watched. It's my favourite movie. I mean Christian Bale was the best Batman ever. And Joker was also best. Believe me both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are best.
"Oh boy.. there's a reason why this movie is so popular. IT'S BRILLIANT!

Remarkable acting, Heath Ledger's performance as Joker felt so realistic, I totally enjoyed the chemistry between Joker and Batman in this movie.

What I didn't like was : how Harvey got his scars..it felt kinda rushed, and the shaky cam is still there, not so prominent as Batman Begins, but still.."
"Just watched the batman, and i had to go back to a movie actually worthy of praise.

Everything about the dark knight is just great. How the shots was made, the music, the tone of the movie and the underlying story/motive."
"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out."
"A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience."
One of my ten favorite films of 2008. Great cast. Oldman deserved an Oscar nomination. The Dark Knight is perhaps the most modern comic blockbuster has given us
"This film didn't spook me when i was young, now with my adult brain, this film is super intense and psychological. The most amazing part is, it's never boring. I didnt check my phone like i usually do. This film made me jump, i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans off...Very good film. Better than no way home. Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me. And I LOVED IT SO MUCH."
"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding."
Everything in this movie is perfect. Joker (Heath ledger ) nailed it. I love the cinematography. And nolans directing.
"I dont have one complaint about this movie. I could watch it every day. Has the perfect amount of action, comedic relief, suspense and drama. Will always be a 10/10 from me."
"This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created. Meticulously plotted, boldly directed, emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking. Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass, screen devouring performance. Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are also incredible.

You need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime - go see it now!!"
"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre."
ONE OF BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!! 4K MUST HAVE!!!!
"The Best Joker ever, just legendary Amazing Extraordinary Complex Dark"
"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

10/10."
"Its one od the best movies of decade,centuries and millenium! Its drama,Action,unexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable. I know you're saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS?"
"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

10/10 rating...well done"
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act. I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes it's villain who steal the show
"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10."
"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."
"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.
My go to movie on a Friday night! Excellent all around!
"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."
"I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for...."
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead)."
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Cinematic masterpiece with a solid 10/10 rating-this movie is truly exceptional. Christopher Nolan's genius shines through, as the film expertly navigates dark tones, immersing the audience in a gripping narrative. The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience, capturing every nuanced detail with precision. From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense, the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable. The actors' performances elevate the film to another level, delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll. In every aspect, this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right."
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie.
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time. Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling."
"This is one of the best movies which I have seen. One of the best movie in all terms. The best part was the villain's role, what a world class acting shown by the actor."
This movie will forever be my all time favorite! Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed.. but it was also released on my birthday! Best movie ever!
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic."
"Bale gud, Heath gud Affleck bad, Pattinson bad This Best movie ever. I rate 5/7.

My favourite hobby, watching this movie n playing Arkham games.

Did I mention bale Gud?"
"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

Rating - 9.6/10."
No one could create a unique Batman better than Nolan.
"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"
"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")"
"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."
"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?"
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

This movie made me tired."
"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up"
"Truly a movie that must be seen by all..I am a Batman fan,my favorite superhero,and Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knight,he did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight,he confirmed it..But to me,i really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledger's breathtaking performance here,i mean how can you not be blown away.?!I'm sorry to Jack Nicholson,he was still incredible in the original but Ledger,WOW..I have always been a fan of Ledger,seen pretty much all of his movies,and with this performance as The Joker,he needs to receive some kind of award,because (RIP) had he been alive,i can guarantee,he will be wanted by all movie directors/studios to be a star of their movies..So,I bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger/ The Joker.."
Excellent film and great performance by Heath Ledger
Awesome movie and fabulous acting of joker and batman
"It's the best superhero movie to date. Amazing casting, the cast played their parts with emotion. Great framing, lighting, suspense and just everything about this movie is amazing!"
Like I said The Dark Knight was the best movie I have watched. It's my favourite movie. I mean Christian Bale was the best Batman ever. And Joker was also best. Believe me both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are best.
"Oh boy.. there's a reason why this movie is so popular. IT'S BRILLIANT!

Remarkable acting, Heath Ledger's performance as Joker felt so realistic, I totally enjoyed the chemistry between Joker and Batman in this movie.

What I didn't like was : how Harvey got his scars..it felt kinda rushed, and the shaky cam is still there, not so prominent as Batman Begins, but still.."
"Just watched the batman, and i had to go back to a movie actually worthy of praise.

Everything about the dark knight is just great. How the shots was made, the music, the tone of the movie and the underlying story/motive."
"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out."
"A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience."
One of my ten favorite films of 2008. Great cast. Oldman deserved an Oscar nomination. The Dark Knight is perhaps the most modern comic blockbuster has given us
"This film didn't spook me when i was young, now with my adult brain, this film is super intense and psychological. The most amazing part is, it's never boring. I didnt check my phone like i usually do. This film made me jump, i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans off...Very good film. Better than no way home. Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me. And I LOVED IT SO MUCH."
"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding."
Everything in this movie is perfect. Joker (Heath ledger ) nailed it. I love the cinematography. And nolans directing.
"I dont have one complaint about this movie. I could watch it every day. Has the perfect amount of action, comedic relief, suspense and drama. Will always be a 10/10 from me."
"This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created. Meticulously plotted, boldly directed, emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking. Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass, screen devouring performance. Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are also incredible.

You need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime - go see it now!!"
"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre."
ONE OF BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!! 4K MUST HAVE!!!!
"The Best Joker ever, just legendary Amazing Extraordinary Complex Dark"
"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."
"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth."
"I'll grant that you have to be fairly intellectual to understand this movie, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless.

Heath Ledger is incredible, probably the greatest acting performance ever from a single actor.

I feel like the intellectual part comes in when you try to understand the characters. I have read other reviews saying that the joker made no sense, but in truth, the darker you think of him, the more sense he makes.

""Plotholes"" are also very easily ""filled"" when paying attention to the film."
An excellent movie with an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker
"A perfectly made movie, with Heath Ledger at his best. Batman Begins started the trend of 'dark/serious' movies, and just when you thought a movie couldn't be better... The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger.

As much as you hate the Joker character in the movie, in the end you truly feel bad. Every scene he's in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV, it's really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something else!

Sadly The Dark Knight Rises wasn't that great, this movie still stands as one of the best movies out there."
"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.

The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.

I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.

The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.

So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

Grade: A"
"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!"
"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.

I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.

But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.

Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.

Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight."
"I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle, Australia(15/7/08), let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008.

Every performance in this movie is just fantastic, and Heath Ledger Owns The JOKER, I don't think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is in.

This has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed, this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original.

Make 2008 the year to see and enjoy one of the years best.

And i hope in Feb 09, Heath is nominated for an Oscar, he will always be remembered Cheers"
"To all the moronic parents who brought their children to this film and complain about it 'not being for kids' and that your 'kids will have nightmares for weeks', here's a clue - it's PG13; and if the voluminous (that means lots of) marketing (this means the advertisements you see on TV and in your People Magazine) isn't enough to give you an idea that this isn't a family superhero movie with a funny clown, then you have nobody to blame than your own dumb self.

The sooner you wake up and pay attention to what you're feeding your children, the sooner the rest of the world can move on without hearing you blame others for your own ineffective (this means dumb) parenting."
"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.

What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.

Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.

Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.

The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.

The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.

For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes."
"Great and worth to watch, The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made."
I love batman he's basically the father I never had.
"Whenever i watch this film, it takes me to another level of creativity. Movie makes me more powerful than ever."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.

Opposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.

But ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.

Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth."
"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.

It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.

The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.

I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).

Final score: 9/10."
"I am not a huge Batman fan. But I finally watched this like 8 years later ... I was hoping for Darker, but for a Batman movie it was action packed. It was like Point Break in Gotham but was entertaining. Ledger was good but not the hype performance everyone freaked about. Good Joker, but he didn't scare me. I want joker to creep me TF out and fear his wrath. OH well. Good movie, totally worth watching. I think Bale is a good Batman but I really like Keaton. I wonder what a new Tim Burton remake would look like with all of the CGI available now that was not around when he made the first Batman with Keaton. I say we petition that. Get Burton on another, really dark one. But please, please, please. No Ben Afleck!

Happy Watching!"
"OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?"
This tital was my good tital wish if i would be like the confidently directed with a complex story.
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

"Its one od the best movies of decade,centuries and millenium! Its drama,Action,unexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable. I know you're saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS?"
"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

10/10 rating...well done"
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act. I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes it's villain who steal the show
"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10."
"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."
"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.
My go to movie on a Friday night! Excellent all around!
"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."
"I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for...."
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead)."
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Cinematic masterpiece with a solid 10/10 rating-this movie is truly exceptional. Christopher Nolan's genius shines through, as the film expertly navigates dark tones, immersing the audience in a gripping narrative. The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience, capturing every nuanced detail with precision. From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense, the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable. The actors' performances elevate the film to another level, delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll. In every aspect, this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right."
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie.
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time. Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling."
"This is one of the best movies which I have seen. One of the best movie in all terms. The best part was the villain's role, what a world class acting shown by the actor."
This movie will forever be my all time favorite! Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed.. but it was also released on my birthday! Best movie ever!
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic."
"Bale gud, Heath gud Affleck bad, Pattinson bad This Best movie ever. I rate 5/7.

My favourite hobby, watching this movie n playing Arkham games.

Did I mention bale Gud?"
"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

Rating - 9.6/10."
No one could create a unique Batman better than Nolan.
"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"
"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")"
"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."
"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?"
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

This movie made me tired."
"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up"
"Truly a movie that must be seen by all..I am a Batman fan,my favorite superhero,and Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knight,he did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight,he confirmed it..But to me,i really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledger's breathtaking performance here,i mean how can you not be blown away.?!I'm sorry to Jack Nicholson,he was still incredible in the original but Ledger,WOW..I have always been a fan of Ledger,seen pretty much all of his movies,and with this performance as The Joker,he needs to receive some kind of award,because (RIP) had he been alive,i can guarantee,he will be wanted by all movie directors/studios to be a star of their movies..So,I bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger/ The Joker.."
Excellent film and great performance by Heath Ledger
Awesome movie and fabulous acting of joker and batman
"It's the best superhero movie to date. Amazing casting, the cast played their parts with emotion. Great framing, lighting, suspense and just everything about this movie is amazing!"
Like I said The Dark Knight was the best movie I have watched. It's my favourite movie. I mean Christian Bale was the best Batman ever. And Joker was also best. Believe me both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are best.
"Oh boy.. there's a reason why this movie is so popular. IT'S BRILLIANT!

Remarkable acting, Heath Ledger's performance as Joker felt so realistic, I totally enjoyed the chemistry between Joker and Batman in this movie.

What I didn't like was : how Harvey got his scars..it felt kinda rushed, and the shaky cam is still there, not so prominent as Batman Begins, but still.."
"Just watched the batman, and i had to go back to a movie actually worthy of praise.

Everything about the dark knight is just great. How the shots was made, the music, the tone of the movie and the underlying story/motive."
"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out."
"A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience."
One of my ten favorite films of 2008. Great cast. Oldman deserved an Oscar nomination. The Dark Knight is perhaps the most modern comic blockbuster has given us
"This film didn't spook me when i was young, now with my adult brain, this film is super intense and psychological. The most amazing part is, it's never boring. I didnt check my phone like i usually do. This film made me jump, i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans off...Very good film. Better than no way home. Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me. And I LOVED IT SO MUCH."
"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding."
Everything in this movie is perfect. Joker (Heath ledger ) nailed it. I love the cinematography. And nolans directing.
"I dont have one complaint about this movie. I could watch it every day. Has the perfect amount of action, comedic relief, suspense and drama. Will always be a 10/10 from me."
"This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created. Meticulously plotted, boldly directed, emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking. Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass, screen devouring performance. Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are also incredible.

You need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime - go see it now!!"
"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre."
ONE OF BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!! 4K MUST HAVE!!!!
"The Best Joker ever, just legendary Amazing Extraordinary Complex Dark"
"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."
"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth."
"I'll grant that you have to be fairly intellectual to understand this movie, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless.

Heath Ledger is incredible, probably the greatest acting performance ever from a single actor.

I feel like the intellectual part comes in when you try to understand the characters. I have read other reviews saying that the joker made no sense, but in truth, the darker you think of him, the more sense he makes.

""Plotholes"" are also very easily ""filled"" when paying attention to the film."
An excellent movie with an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker
"A perfectly made movie, with Heath Ledger at his best. Batman Begins started the trend of 'dark/serious' movies, and just when you thought a movie couldn't be better... The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger.

As much as you hate the Joker character in the movie, in the end you truly feel bad. Every scene he's in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV, it's really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something else!

Sadly The Dark Knight Rises wasn't that great, this movie still stands as one of the best movies out there."
"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.

The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.

I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.

The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.

So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

Grade: A"
"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!"
"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.

I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.

But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.

Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.

Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight."
"I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle, Australia(15/7/08), let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008.

Every performance in this movie is just fantastic, and Heath Ledger Owns The JOKER, I don't think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is in.

This has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed, this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original.

Make 2008 the year to see and enjoy one of the years best.

And i hope in Feb 09, Heath is nominated for an Oscar, he will always be remembered Cheers"
"To all the moronic parents who brought their children to this film and complain about it 'not being for kids' and that your 'kids will have nightmares for weeks', here's a clue - it's PG13; and if the voluminous (that means lots of) marketing (this means the advertisements you see on TV and in your People Magazine) isn't enough to give you an idea that this isn't a family superhero movie with a funny clown, then you have nobody to blame than your own dumb self.

The sooner you wake up and pay attention to what you're feeding your children, the sooner the rest of the world can move on without hearing you blame others for your own ineffective (this means dumb) parenting."
"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.

What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.

Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.

Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.

The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.

The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.

For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes."
"Great and worth to watch, The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made."
I love batman he's basically the father I never had.
"Whenever i watch this film, it takes me to another level of creativity. Movie makes me more powerful than ever."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.

Opposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.

But ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.

Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth."
"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.

It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.

The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.

I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).

Final score: 9/10."
"I am not a huge Batman fan. But I finally watched this like 8 years later ... I was hoping for Darker, but for a Batman movie it was action packed. It was like Point Break in Gotham but was entertaining. Ledger was good but not the hype performance everyone freaked about. Good Joker, but he didn't scare me. I want joker to creep me TF out and fear his wrath. OH well. Good movie, totally worth watching. I think Bale is a good Batman but I really like Keaton. I wonder what a new Tim Burton remake would look like with all of the CGI available now that was not around when he made the first Batman with Keaton. I say we petition that. Get Burton on another, really dark one. But please, please, please. No Ben Afleck!

Happy Watching!"
"OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?"
This tital was my good tital wish if i would be like the confidently directed with a complex story.
I've lost count of how many times i have watched this. Returned to it after watching Joker. Different interpretation but Ledger's Joker is perfection
Joker was absolutely amazing! Simply a must see film for anyone who wishes to see the best joker performance.
"Absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen. The Joker and Batman fantastically portrayed by Heath and Christian with phenomenal chemistry between the characters. Over a decade on since it was released and countless superhero watched by myself since and this is still definitely the best one out there. The depth and rationalities the joker gives leave the viewer wondering whether he is crazy or completely sane in this thought provoking cinematic masterpiece.

No spoilers here but when you watch it you will be on the edge of your seat with anticipation, you will also feel so connected to both the joker and batman on an emotional level."
"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress!

As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.

I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.

This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10. Having said that, this is nothing more than 'popcorn' film."
I love it. There was so much here and I particularly loved this take on the Joker.
GREAT MOVIE. MUST SEEN. HEATH LEADGER IS INCREDIBLE CLEARLY THE BEST JOKER RIP
"Forever immortal icon Above classification level, it has a very good cast with talented acting and a talented director The movie you will never get poring of watching it.

I wish for everyone a pleasant watching."
"""The Dark Knight"" goes far beyond the label of a blockbuster or action film. Christopher Nolan crafts a powerful cinematic experience, confronting audiences with ethical and psychological dilemmas that stretch beyond the genre's conventions. Right from the start, the film challenges us to follow Batman in a struggle that goes beyond physical fights, diving deep into the dark territory of moral choices. More than a simple hero-villain face-off, Nolan shows just how much Bruce Wayne is driven-not by glory-but by a compulsive need to do what's right in a world where ""right"" is increasingly ambiguous. At its core, the film explores complex themes like sacrifice, surveillance, and the price of morality, redefining what to expect from a superhero adaptation.

The backbone of ""The Dark Knight"" is the dynamic between Batman and the Joker, portrayed iconically by Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is utterly disturbing, driven by a logic-defying impulse to expose humanity's fragility. This Joker embodies chaos in its purest form, revealing and manipulating Gotham's and Batman's vulnerabilities. More than an antagonist, he's a chaotic force that pushes Batman to question his own values, forcing him to confront the moral shadows of his own actions. The Joker imposes impossible dilemmas on Gotham and Batman alike, serving as a twisted mirror for Bruce Wayne's limitations and the clash between justice and obsession.

Christian Bale gives a gritty performance, turning Bruce Wayne into one of cinema's most complex characters. Instead of a perfect hero, his Batman is a man exhausted, torn between his commitment to protect Gotham and the personal toll of that mission. Bale brings a physicality to the role, using a raspy, intense voice under the cowl to express Batman's psychological weight. He masterfully balances the carefree playboy persona with the brooding vigilante, underscoring that Bruce is as masked in public as he is in the cape. In his interactions with the Joker, Bale conveys a complex mix of anger, frustration, and vulnerability, making him a powerful hero who struggles and wears down like anyone in Gotham. Bale's raw authenticity makes his Batman unforgettable, pushing beyond the superhero archetype into a movingly human portrayal.

The urban setting of Gotham becomes another main character, with a darkly realistic design heightened by cinematography that avoids over-the-top visuals while retaining the city's oppressive identity. Gotham is a battlefield where fear and corruption touch every scene, reflecting the complex morality of its residents. Each shot is carefully crafted to create a space where Batman is a dark vigilante and paradoxically vulnerable, as if the very place constantly reminds him of the impossibility of eradicating evil completely. Nolan makes Gotham a believable city where heroism meets real-world barriers, adding to the thick, intense atmosphere throughout the film.

Bruce Wayne's moral journey is heightened when he sees hope in Harvey Dent, believing him capable of carrying the weight of justice without turning to darkness. Aaron Eckhart plays Dent with idealistic energy that slowly breaks under pressure and tragedy, showing the fall of a ""White Knight"" into a haunting Two-Face. The story carefully parallels Dent's downfall with Batman's sacrifices, suggesting that even the purest heroes can be corrupted by pain and loss. This duality between Bruce and Dent deepens the story, and instead of simplifying the hero-villain theme, it builds complex characters who shift between light and shadow, highlighting the real cost of justice.

Nolan boldly takes on contemporary ethical questions, like surveillance and power boundaries, exploring just how far security can justify the loss of privacy. Batman's use of mass surveillance technology to catch the Joker raises the ends-versus-means debate. This decision creates one of the movie's most crucial conflicts, with Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) acting as a moral compass, challenging Batman's methods. The clash between safety and ethics lends the film a relevance that resonates beyond fiction, sparking reflections on society and the role of power in protection or oppression. Nolan's choice to include this conversation elevates ""The Dark Knight"" from action flick to critical commentary, raising questions that stick with viewers.

Technically, the film is flawless, with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enriching the atmosphere with tension and emotional depth. The sound design is especially effective in Joker scenes, marked by a sharp, ominous sound that builds sinister anticipation before he even speaks. The action scenes, executed with realism and precision, are dynamic and visually impactful without overshadowing the plot or characters, always advancing the story. Nolan strategically uses every technical element to heighten the narrative, immersing viewers in Bruce Wayne's moral struggle-a vigilante constantly torn between his principles and actions.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" transcends the superhero genre by diving into themes of morality, sacrifice, and humanity's darker side. Nolan drives a narrative that challenges audiences to see beyond the battle of good versus evil, questioning the cost of being a hero in a world where justice and ethics often clash. Batman's final image, bearing Gotham's sins and fading into the shadows, is one of cinema's most iconic and melancholy shots, capturing the weight of his burden and the complexity of his role. Ultimately, the film stands as a masterpiece that redefines genre expectations, leaving a lasting mark on both superhero films and the cinematic landscape."
"He really makes this movie. His joker is iconic truly a bar to reach for, for all other actors."
Heathe Leadger the best interpretation in the world
"In The Dark Night Movie, Joker in this movie is really a legend, He is my favorite Character in this movie, more then the Hero. The Hero is the Batmen but most famous character is the joker, the way he presents his character is mind blowing, i always gonna miss his acting, i wish he is alive so i can see him in more movies and more shades of characters. Batmen is a Super hero but Joker is a Super Villain of all time. Nolan is a great filmmaker who knows the core of emotions and character design, his script and dialogues are amazing, he is one of the best filmmaker of this century. Many filmmakers learn filmmaking from his style."
"when I gave my opinion with 9 marks ,I was not give it for the movie or for Christian Bale or for director but only for Heath Ledger who made A wonderful performance,he was able to delve deeper into this character ,really with loud voice and A great honor I want to say BRAVOOOOOOO!!! But in general the story was amazing especially in last minutes,and as always Morgan Freeman Was scintillating ,and Maggie Gyllenhaal also. finally I believe that without Heath Ledger and his performance this movie was not take more than 6 because he was the secret of success. thanks Heath Ledger and we will not forget you and your fantastic performance..."
"Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife.

Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise.

What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit.

Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here."
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.

That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.

Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.

3/10"
"If you're interested in acting, filmmaking or movies... this is one of the greatest examples of all of that. Whole Nolan's trilogy is masterpiece. But this second movie is probably the greatest one of them."
"All you need to do is switch this film on for 30 seconds, and your hooked. Simple"
"The movie showed how a real villain can cause this much chaos to the city. And how he really pushed Batman to his edge, yet not all of them are strong like Batam as some crossed the line. The best movie that shows the two iconic figures Batman and Joker rival together."
Heath Ledger will forever be the best joker ever!!! and christian bale was a decent batman in my opinion.
"Iconic! ""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre. Released in 2008, this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances. At its core, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's posthumous Academy Award-winning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist, making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchy.

Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, brings a brooding intensity that complements the film's exploration of duality and morality. Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself. The cinematography, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, adds layers of tension and depth to the narrative.

""The Dark Knight"" transcends the typical superhero narrative, evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism. The film's social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout, challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally. As the capstone of Nolan's Batman trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a high standard with its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and cinematic brilliance.

This film isn't just a comic book adaptation; it's a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable, and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers, setting a standard that few have matched. ""The Dark Knight"" remains a beacon of excellence, reminding us that a superhero film can be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern filmmaking."
"This movie is very blockbuster of Christopher nolan and i like this movie so much. And, this movie, everybody like this because, christian bale nailed it in this movie and its better than robert pattison's movie named 'batman'. Some scenes in this movie is mind-blowing and crazy, i really like this movie. The villain in this character is very fantastic and awesome role-play of villain. And im giving this movie as 10/10. Christopher nolan choose the right character of hero and im surprised and everyone in youtube got viral and lots of moments and everybody should watch this movie, its very amazing."
Hands Down this is the greatest Superhero movie of all time Better than any marvel movie The best Batman Best Joker Best Harvey Dent/Two Face Heath Ledgers performance as the joker was just epic.
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

10/10."
"Its one od the best movies of decade,centuries and millenium! Its drama,Action,unexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable. I know you're saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS?"
"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

10/10 rating...well done"
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act. I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes it's villain who steal the show
"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10."
"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."
"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.
My go to movie on a Friday night! Excellent all around!
"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."
"I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for...."
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead)."
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Cinematic masterpiece with a solid 10/10 rating-this movie is truly exceptional. Christopher Nolan's genius shines through, as the film expertly navigates dark tones, immersing the audience in a gripping narrative. The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience, capturing every nuanced detail with precision. From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense, the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable. The actors' performances elevate the film to another level, delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll. In every aspect, this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right."
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie.
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time. Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling."
"This is one of the best movies which I have seen. One of the best movie in all terms. The best part was the villain's role, what a world class acting shown by the actor."
This movie will forever be my all time favorite! Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed.. but it was also released on my birthday! Best movie ever!
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic."
"Bale gud, Heath gud Affleck bad, Pattinson bad This Best movie ever. I rate 5/7.

My favourite hobby, watching this movie n playing Arkham games.

Did I mention bale Gud?"
"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

Rating - 9.6/10."
No one could create a unique Batman better than Nolan.
"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"
"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")"
"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."
"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?"
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

This movie made me tired."
"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up"
"Truly a movie that must be seen by all..I am a Batman fan,my favorite superhero,and Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knight,he did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight,he confirmed it..But to me,i really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledger's breathtaking performance here,i mean how can you not be blown away.?!I'm sorry to Jack Nicholson,he was still incredible in the original but Ledger,WOW..I have always been a fan of Ledger,seen pretty much all of his movies,and with this performance as The Joker,he needs to receive some kind of award,because (RIP) had he been alive,i can guarantee,he will be wanted by all movie directors/studios to be a star of their movies..So,I bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger/ The Joker.."
Excellent film and great performance by Heath Ledger
Awesome movie and fabulous acting of joker and batman
"It's the best superhero movie to date. Amazing casting, the cast played their parts with emotion. Great framing, lighting, suspense and just everything about this movie is amazing!"
Like I said The Dark Knight was the best movie I have watched. It's my favourite movie. I mean Christian Bale was the best Batman ever. And Joker was also best. Believe me both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are best.
"Oh boy.. there's a reason why this movie is so popular. IT'S BRILLIANT!

Remarkable acting, Heath Ledger's performance as Joker felt so realistic, I totally enjoyed the chemistry between Joker and Batman in this movie.

What I didn't like was : how Harvey got his scars..it felt kinda rushed, and the shaky cam is still there, not so prominent as Batman Begins, but still.."
"Just watched the batman, and i had to go back to a movie actually worthy of praise.

Everything about the dark knight is just great. How the shots was made, the music, the tone of the movie and the underlying story/motive."
"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out."
"A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience."
One of my ten favorite films of 2008. Great cast. Oldman deserved an Oscar nomination. The Dark Knight is perhaps the most modern comic blockbuster has given us
"This film didn't spook me when i was young, now with my adult brain, this film is super intense and psychological. The most amazing part is, it's never boring. I didnt check my phone like i usually do. This film made me jump, i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans off...Very good film. Better than no way home. Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me. And I LOVED IT SO MUCH."
"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding."
Everything in this movie is perfect. Joker (Heath ledger ) nailed it. I love the cinematography. And nolans directing.
"I dont have one complaint about this movie. I could watch it every day. Has the perfect amount of action, comedic relief, suspense and drama. Will always be a 10/10 from me."
"This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created. Meticulously plotted, boldly directed, emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking. Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass, screen devouring performance. Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are also incredible.

You need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime - go see it now!!"
"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre."
ONE OF BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!! 4K MUST HAVE!!!!
"The Best Joker ever, just legendary Amazing Extraordinary Complex Dark"
"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."
"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth."
"I'll grant that you have to be fairly intellectual to understand this movie, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless.

Heath Ledger is incredible, probably the greatest acting performance ever from a single actor.

I feel like the intellectual part comes in when you try to understand the characters. I have read other reviews saying that the joker made no sense, but in truth, the darker you think of him, the more sense he makes.

""Plotholes"" are also very easily ""filled"" when paying attention to the film."
An excellent movie with an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker
"A perfectly made movie, with Heath Ledger at his best. Batman Begins started the trend of 'dark/serious' movies, and just when you thought a movie couldn't be better... The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger.

As much as you hate the Joker character in the movie, in the end you truly feel bad. Every scene he's in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV, it's really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something else!

Sadly The Dark Knight Rises wasn't that great, this movie still stands as one of the best movies out there."
"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.

The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.

I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.

The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.

So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

Grade: A"
"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!"
"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.

I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.

But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.

Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.

Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight."
"I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle, Australia(15/7/08), let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008.

Every performance in this movie is just fantastic, and Heath Ledger Owns The JOKER, I don't think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is in.

This has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed, this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original.

Make 2008 the year to see and enjoy one of the years best.

And i hope in Feb 09, Heath is nominated for an Oscar, he will always be remembered Cheers"
"To all the moronic parents who brought their children to this film and complain about it 'not being for kids' and that your 'kids will have nightmares for weeks', here's a clue - it's PG13; and if the voluminous (that means lots of) marketing (this means the advertisements you see on TV and in your People Magazine) isn't enough to give you an idea that this isn't a family superhero movie with a funny clown, then you have nobody to blame than your own dumb self.

The sooner you wake up and pay attention to what you're feeding your children, the sooner the rest of the world can move on without hearing you blame others for your own ineffective (this means dumb) parenting."
"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.

What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.

Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.

Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.

The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.

The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.

For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes."
"Great and worth to watch, The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made."
I love batman he's basically the father I never had.
"Whenever i watch this film, it takes me to another level of creativity. Movie makes me more powerful than ever."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.

Opposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.

But ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.

Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth."
"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.

It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.

The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.

I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).

Final score: 9/10."
"I am not a huge Batman fan. But I finally watched this like 8 years later ... I was hoping for Darker, but for a Batman movie it was action packed. It was like Point Break in Gotham but was entertaining. Ledger was good but not the hype performance everyone freaked about. Good Joker, but he didn't scare me. I want joker to creep me TF out and fear his wrath. OH well. Good movie, totally worth watching. I think Bale is a good Batman but I really like Keaton. I wonder what a new Tim Burton remake would look like with all of the CGI available now that was not around when he made the first Batman with Keaton. I say we petition that. Get Burton on another, really dark one. But please, please, please. No Ben Afleck!

Happy Watching!"
"OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?"
This tital was my good tital wish if i would be like the confidently directed with a complex story.
I've lost count of how many times i have watched this. Returned to it after watching Joker. Different interpretation but Ledger's Joker is perfection
Joker was absolutely amazing! Simply a must see film for anyone who wishes to see the best joker performance.
"Absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen. The Joker and Batman fantastically portrayed by Heath and Christian with phenomenal chemistry between the characters. Over a decade on since it was released and countless superhero watched by myself since and this is still definitely the best one out there. The depth and rationalities the joker gives leave the viewer wondering whether he is crazy or completely sane in this thought provoking cinematic masterpiece.

No spoilers here but when you watch it you will be on the edge of your seat with anticipation, you will also feel so connected to both the joker and batman on an emotional level."
"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress!

As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.

I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.

This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10. Having said that, this is nothing more than 'popcorn' film."
I love it. There was so much here and I particularly loved this take on the Joker.
GREAT MOVIE. MUST SEEN. HEATH LEADGER IS INCREDIBLE CLEARLY THE BEST JOKER RIP
"Forever immortal icon Above classification level, it has a very good cast with talented acting and a talented director The movie you will never get poring of watching it.

I wish for everyone a pleasant watching."
"""The Dark Knight"" goes far beyond the label of a blockbuster or action film. Christopher Nolan crafts a powerful cinematic experience, confronting audiences with ethical and psychological dilemmas that stretch beyond the genre's conventions. Right from the start, the film challenges us to follow Batman in a struggle that goes beyond physical fights, diving deep into the dark territory of moral choices. More than a simple hero-villain face-off, Nolan shows just how much Bruce Wayne is driven-not by glory-but by a compulsive need to do what's right in a world where ""right"" is increasingly ambiguous. At its core, the film explores complex themes like sacrifice, surveillance, and the price of morality, redefining what to expect from a superhero adaptation.

The backbone of ""The Dark Knight"" is the dynamic between Batman and the Joker, portrayed iconically by Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is utterly disturbing, driven by a logic-defying impulse to expose humanity's fragility. This Joker embodies chaos in its purest form, revealing and manipulating Gotham's and Batman's vulnerabilities. More than an antagonist, he's a chaotic force that pushes Batman to question his own values, forcing him to confront the moral shadows of his own actions. The Joker imposes impossible dilemmas on Gotham and Batman alike, serving as a twisted mirror for Bruce Wayne's limitations and the clash between justice and obsession.

Christian Bale gives a gritty performance, turning Bruce Wayne into one of cinema's most complex characters. Instead of a perfect hero, his Batman is a man exhausted, torn between his commitment to protect Gotham and the personal toll of that mission. Bale brings a physicality to the role, using a raspy, intense voice under the cowl to express Batman's psychological weight. He masterfully balances the carefree playboy persona with the brooding vigilante, underscoring that Bruce is as masked in public as he is in the cape. In his interactions with the Joker, Bale conveys a complex mix of anger, frustration, and vulnerability, making him a powerful hero who struggles and wears down like anyone in Gotham. Bale's raw authenticity makes his Batman unforgettable, pushing beyond the superhero archetype into a movingly human portrayal.

The urban setting of Gotham becomes another main character, with a darkly realistic design heightened by cinematography that avoids over-the-top visuals while retaining the city's oppressive identity. Gotham is a battlefield where fear and corruption touch every scene, reflecting the complex morality of its residents. Each shot is carefully crafted to create a space where Batman is a dark vigilante and paradoxically vulnerable, as if the very place constantly reminds him of the impossibility of eradicating evil completely. Nolan makes Gotham a believable city where heroism meets real-world barriers, adding to the thick, intense atmosphere throughout the film.

Bruce Wayne's moral journey is heightened when he sees hope in Harvey Dent, believing him capable of carrying the weight of justice without turning to darkness. Aaron Eckhart plays Dent with idealistic energy that slowly breaks under pressure and tragedy, showing the fall of a ""White Knight"" into a haunting Two-Face. The story carefully parallels Dent's downfall with Batman's sacrifices, suggesting that even the purest heroes can be corrupted by pain and loss. This duality between Bruce and Dent deepens the story, and instead of simplifying the hero-villain theme, it builds complex characters who shift between light and shadow, highlighting the real cost of justice.

Nolan boldly takes on contemporary ethical questions, like surveillance and power boundaries, exploring just how far security can justify the loss of privacy. Batman's use of mass surveillance technology to catch the Joker raises the ends-versus-means debate. This decision creates one of the movie's most crucial conflicts, with Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) acting as a moral compass, challenging Batman's methods. The clash between safety and ethics lends the film a relevance that resonates beyond fiction, sparking reflections on society and the role of power in protection or oppression. Nolan's choice to include this conversation elevates ""The Dark Knight"" from action flick to critical commentary, raising questions that stick with viewers.

Technically, the film is flawless, with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enriching the atmosphere with tension and emotional depth. The sound design is especially effective in Joker scenes, marked by a sharp, ominous sound that builds sinister anticipation before he even speaks. The action scenes, executed with realism and precision, are dynamic and visually impactful without overshadowing the plot or characters, always advancing the story. Nolan strategically uses every technical element to heighten the narrative, immersing viewers in Bruce Wayne's moral struggle-a vigilante constantly torn between his principles and actions.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" transcends the superhero genre by diving into themes of morality, sacrifice, and humanity's darker side. Nolan drives a narrative that challenges audiences to see beyond the battle of good versus evil, questioning the cost of being a hero in a world where justice and ethics often clash. Batman's final image, bearing Gotham's sins and fading into the shadows, is one of cinema's most iconic and melancholy shots, capturing the weight of his burden and the complexity of his role. Ultimately, the film stands as a masterpiece that redefines genre expectations, leaving a lasting mark on both superhero films and the cinematic landscape."
"He really makes this movie. His joker is iconic truly a bar to reach for, for all other actors."
Heathe Leadger the best interpretation in the world
"In The Dark Night Movie, Joker in this movie is really a legend, He is my favorite Character in this movie, more then the Hero. The Hero is the Batmen but most famous character is the joker, the way he presents his character is mind blowing, i always gonna miss his acting, i wish he is alive so i can see him in more movies and more shades of characters. Batmen is a Super hero but Joker is a Super Villain of all time. Nolan is a great filmmaker who knows the core of emotions and character design, his script and dialogues are amazing, he is one of the best filmmaker of this century. Many filmmakers learn filmmaking from his style."
"when I gave my opinion with 9 marks ,I was not give it for the movie or for Christian Bale or for director but only for Heath Ledger who made A wonderful performance,he was able to delve deeper into this character ,really with loud voice and A great honor I want to say BRAVOOOOOOO!!! But in general the story was amazing especially in last minutes,and as always Morgan Freeman Was scintillating ,and Maggie Gyllenhaal also. finally I believe that without Heath Ledger and his performance this movie was not take more than 6 because he was the secret of success. thanks Heath Ledger and we will not forget you and your fantastic performance..."
"Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife.

Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise.

What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit.

Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here."
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.

That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.

Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.

3/10"
"If you're interested in acting, filmmaking or movies... this is one of the greatest examples of all of that. Whole Nolan's trilogy is masterpiece. But this second movie is probably the greatest one of them."
"All you need to do is switch this film on for 30 seconds, and your hooked. Simple"
"The movie showed how a real villain can cause this much chaos to the city. And how he really pushed Batman to his edge, yet not all of them are strong like Batam as some crossed the line. The best movie that shows the two iconic figures Batman and Joker rival together."
Heath Ledger will forever be the best joker ever!!! and christian bale was a decent batman in my opinion.
"Iconic! ""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre. Released in 2008, this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances. At its core, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's posthumous Academy Award-winning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist, making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchy.

Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, brings a brooding intensity that complements the film's exploration of duality and morality. Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself. The cinematography, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, adds layers of tension and depth to the narrative.

""The Dark Knight"" transcends the typical superhero narrative, evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism. The film's social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout, challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally. As the capstone of Nolan's Batman trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a high standard with its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and cinematic brilliance.

This film isn't just a comic book adaptation; it's a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable, and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers, setting a standard that few have matched. ""The Dark Knight"" remains a beacon of excellence, reminding us that a superhero film can be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern filmmaking."
"This movie is very blockbuster of Christopher nolan and i like this movie so much. And, this movie, everybody like this because, christian bale nailed it in this movie and its better than robert pattison's movie named 'batman'. Some scenes in this movie is mind-blowing and crazy, i really like this movie. The villain in this character is very fantastic and awesome role-play of villain. And im giving this movie as 10/10. Christopher nolan choose the right character of hero and im surprised and everyone in youtube got viral and lots of moments and everybody should watch this movie, its very amazing."
Hands Down this is the greatest Superhero movie of all time Better than any marvel movie The best Batman Best Joker Best Harvey Dent/Two Face Heath Ledgers performance as the joker was just epic.
"Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.

As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.

Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.

Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.

And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.

The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.

But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.

So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger."
"i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10."
"""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic masterpiece that redefines the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's direction masterfully weaves a gripping narrative filled with moral complexity and intense action. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary; he embodies chaos with chilling charisma and depth, creating an iconic villain that lingers long after the credits roll. The film's exploration of duality, justice, and sacrifice resonates deeply, making it a profound experience. With stunning visuals, a haunting score, and unforgettable performances, ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a flawless triumph in filmmaking that elevates both its characters and its themes to unforgettable heights."
"This is one of those movies that you must watch it with one sit from the beginning to the end without making you lose any interest in it. I also watched the continuation of this movie it wasn't bad at all, there are few movies which i like to watch with one sit and they are really few i personally don't really like superhero movies that much but this one really got my attention i mean it has Christian Bale (Batman) in it of course it was going to be a really enjoying movie i recommend to anyone who have not watched the movie to see it really is an impressive one really sad that we can not have a joker like this one anymore i mean Heath Ledger (Joker) really hit that high joker performance he was and still is for me the best joker in a batman movie."
"The only superhero movie that can call itself a masterpiece. A film about good and evil, anarchy and authoritarianism, supposed order and chaos. Two sides of the same coin, two weights of a scale, if one of them is missing, the other cannot exist."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends intense action, profound storytelling, and unforgettable performances. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of mesmerizing, elevating the film to unparalleled heights. Nolan's direction, coupled with Hans Zimmer's iconic score, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that captivates audiences from start to finish. The film's exploration of morality and the complexities of heroism cements its status as a modern masterpiece in the superhero genre.

Nolan's visionary storytelling and Bale's compelling Batman make ""The Dark Knight"" a timeless masterpiece."
", yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Heath ledgers character, the joker is phenomenal. One of the best acting performances ever. The dark night is a great movie, but not the best. Not in the top 25. It's Avery good movie with a thrilling story but it is a bit overrated. This movie never really gets old. And the story of heath ledger and the joker role pushing his mental state further. Heath ledger unfortunately killed himself after the role. Don't get me wrong, the dark knight is a great, excellent movie but it shouldn't be the top 3 of the world, even nearly the top 10. But the dark knight is the best sequel for a Christopher Nolan movie ever. Thank you Christopher Nolan for making the greatest superhero movie of all time."
"This is a movie which deserves more than review. O ly two word enough to explain : Almost Perfect

The job is perfect you can see the sweet of cristopher nolan in the every part of movie. There is a huge work behind this masterpiece. It has a well originated story and it has been empowered with the top class acting.

Best batman casting so far.

It is the best till the nolan decide to direct better batman movie."
Great superhero movie.I think this is the best Batman movie that has been created so far. The leading actor who plays the Joker is believe-able and draws you into the movie. The storyline was well put together and award worthy.
"After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie.

Man was i disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.

Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.

But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.

Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.

There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.

All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy.

It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.

Happy to share my feel about this movie,

Realkane"
"This movie is like a rollercoaster, the acting of Heath Ledger elevates the movie but Bale doesn't dissapoint no one is bad, the action is sooo gooooddd you can't even blink in this movie, the duo of Batman & Joker is so well crafted, it's an antagonist-protagonist relation that develops both, especially the protagonist. The ending is absolutely peak it gives you that sour felling but also hopeful, just absolutely peak but you should watch Batman Begins first it's possible to enjoy The Dark Knight without watching it but with Begins it's even better.

Conclusion: Watch it its peak absolutely peak."
"Christian bale was great acting as Batman . However , Heath ledger performance as joker is a masterpiece no one will ever top him deserved.

Rip Heath ledger greatest performance in film history."
"Although the Batman is not longer young, he can change the world to become better. I am looking forward to the next one, next fantastic one."
"The only negative I could give this movie is that the protagonist overshadows the main role of hero. After all, it is a batman movie. But lets face it, of all the good actors in the movie, Heath Ledger blows everyone away with his role of the joker. Not just for this movie, but this may be one of the best acting roles in history. The performance of his life. ( no pun intended ). Its a shame he died, there were more great performances in him, sadly we will never see. It would be a reasonable supposition to believe that ledger's performance may have been so extreme and brilliant due to psychological issues he was experiencing at the time which ultimately took his life. A candle burning too bright and will be missed."
"Christopher Nolan, Heath Ledger outstanding combo -plus christian Bale is amazing but the villain stole the light, and took a standing ovation by the world. Joker is the real trump card of this movie and the best until now."
"Oh, what a film! 🦇🌑 This movie is a towering achievement in the superhero genre, pushing the boundaries of storytelling and redefining what a comic book adaptation can be. Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a dark and gritty atmosphere that perfectly complements the complex themes explored in the film. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is truly mesmerizing and unforgettable, earning him a posthumous Academy Award. The film's thought-provoking exploration of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism makes it a standout in the genre. It's a must-watch for any fan of superhero movies or thrilling, thought-provoking cinema. Don't miss out on this epic Batman adventure! 🦇🌟"
"Feel that this movie is simply beautiful, I don't mind the fact that it is long, about 2 and a half hours?, but what if it is the perfect movie from experience, I went to see it at the cinema, and since then I have seen few Sometimes so as not to get bored with her, but I remember her as a damn exam man, and as Gordon says at the end, he's a hero, but that we don't need now, ...... the Dark Knight, ufff and that soundtrack , papa buenisimooooo, and finally, ... HE IS BATMAN."
"Title: ""A Cinematic Triumph: 'The Dark Knight' Reimagines Batman Like Never Before""

Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Released in 2008, this film marked a pivotal moment in the superhero genre, forever changing the way audiences perceive not only Batman but also the entire genre itself. With a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, unforgettable performances, and groundbreaking visuals, ""The Dark Knight"" remains an iconic achievement.

At its core, ""The Dark Knight"" is a crime drama wrapped in the guise of a superhero movie. Unlike its predecessors, this installment presents Batman as a complex vigilante facing moral dilemmas rather than a mere caped crusader fighting crime. Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delivers a mesmerizing performance. His portrayal is a perfect blend of brooding intensity and vulnerability, allowing the audience to empathize with the inner turmoil of the character.

However, the true standout performance in ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's take on the iconic Batman villain is nothing short of extraordinary. His Joker is an agent of chaos, a sadistic and unpredictable force who challenges Batman both physically and philosophically. Ledger's commitment to the role is palpable, and he disappears into the character, leaving the audience in awe of his magnetic and chilling performance. It's no exaggeration to say that Ledger's Joker is one of the most iconic and memorable villains in cinematic history.

The supporting cast also shines in their respective roles. Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon is the moral compass of Gotham City, and Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is a charismatic district attorney whose transformation into Two-Face is both tragic and compelling. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine bring depth and wisdom to their characters, providing the emotional grounding needed amidst the chaos.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a dark and gritty Gotham City that feels both hauntingly realistic and heightened in its cinematic grandeur. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and shot, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding intensity of Batman's world. Nolan's use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds a tangible weight to the film's action, making every punch and explosion feel real.

One of the most remarkable aspects of ""The Dark Knight"" is its exploration of complex moral themes. The film delves into questions of justice, morality, and the nature of heroism. Batman's ethical code is put to the test as he faces the Joker's nihilistic philosophy. The film challenges the audience to consider the cost of heroism and the blurred line between hero and villain.

In addition to its thematic depth, ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterclass in storytelling. The script, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a taut and intelligent narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene building upon the last, leading to a breathtaking climax that will leave you breathless.

Hans Zimmer's score is another element that elevates ""The Dark Knight"" to a cinematic tour de force. The hauntingly beautiful music underscores the emotional beats of the film, heightening the tension and drama. Zimmer's use of recurring motifs, such as the Joker's theme, adds a layer of psychological depth to the characters.

It's worth noting that ""The Dark Knight"" is not a typical superhero film. It transcends the genre by delivering a mature and thought-provoking narrative that appeals to a broad audience. While it contains thrilling action sequences and epic battles, it also explores the human side of its characters, making it a character-driven drama that just happens to involve superheroes.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that redefined the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance as the Joker, and the film's exploration of complex moral themes all contribute to its status as a modern classic. It's a film that continues to resonate with audiences and stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in cinema. Whether you're a fan of Batman or simply a lover of great filmmaking, ""The Dark Knight"" is a must-see that will leave you pondering its themes long after the credits roll."
"Spectacular and entertaining but no more than that.

Batman Begins is way better. This movie has nothing to add that movie and/or original story.

Be honest! What do you remember about this movie, a week after seeing it? Just the Joker walking out the exploding hospital I guess.

Nicely done but not ""Nolan proof"". Please don't make a third one Christopher (you're still one of my favorite directors).

Summary: go see it for it's spectacular actions and... that's it.

Nothing more! (sorry)

This is the required 10th line"
"Amazing movie by Nolan, could not make a more real version of Bats and Joker"
"For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

excellent movie ever! the ""joker"" character was outstanding! the heath ledger gives excellent performance in this movie,and the best music work by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard,this is a blockbuster movie of 2008.GENIUS AT WORK by Christopher Nolan.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a MASTERPIECE 10 of 10 stars."
This Movie for sure made me see batman in a different light after all he is a human and has no super powers but it just shows that you don't need super powers to be a super hero. I really liked the action in this particular film compared to the other batman films Christan Bale did a great job as batman and is possibly my preferred batman overall in the batman series. Pretty soon the new batman vs Superman will be coming out although I myself am not really a D.C fan I am definitely going to be seeing that after I watch Marvels Captain America World At War maybe after seeing Batman V.S Superman I may convert into a D.C fan and after seeing pictures of the movie that is a very likely chance
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

10/10."
"Its one od the best movies of decade,centuries and millenium! Its drama,Action,unexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable. I know you're saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS?"
"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!

The Dark Knight score: A + .

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

10/10 rating...well done"
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act. I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes it's villain who steal the show
"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10."
"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."
"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.
My go to movie on a Friday night! Excellent all around!
"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."
"I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for...."
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead)."
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Cinematic masterpiece with a solid 10/10 rating-this movie is truly exceptional. Christopher Nolan's genius shines through, as the film expertly navigates dark tones, immersing the audience in a gripping narrative. The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience, capturing every nuanced detail with precision. From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense, the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable. The actors' performances elevate the film to another level, delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll. In every aspect, this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right."
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie.
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time. Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling."
"This is one of the best movies which I have seen. One of the best movie in all terms. The best part was the villain's role, what a world class acting shown by the actor."
This movie will forever be my all time favorite! Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed.. but it was also released on my birthday! Best movie ever!
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic."
"Bale gud, Heath gud Affleck bad, Pattinson bad This Best movie ever. I rate 5/7.

My favourite hobby, watching this movie n playing Arkham games.

Did I mention bale Gud?"
"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

Rating - 9.6/10."
No one could create a unique Batman better than Nolan.
"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"
"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")"
"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."
"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?"
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

This movie made me tired."
"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up"
"Truly a movie that must be seen by all..I am a Batman fan,my favorite superhero,and Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knight,he did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight,he confirmed it..But to me,i really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledger's breathtaking performance here,i mean how can you not be blown away.?!I'm sorry to Jack Nicholson,he was still incredible in the original but Ledger,WOW..I have always been a fan of Ledger,seen pretty much all of his movies,and with this performance as The Joker,he needs to receive some kind of award,because (RIP) had he been alive,i can guarantee,he will be wanted by all movie directors/studios to be a star of their movies..So,I bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger/ The Joker.."
Excellent film and great performance by Heath Ledger
Awesome movie and fabulous acting of joker and batman
"It's the best superhero movie to date. Amazing casting, the cast played their parts with emotion. Great framing, lighting, suspense and just everything about this movie is amazing!"
Like I said The Dark Knight was the best movie I have watched. It's my favourite movie. I mean Christian Bale was the best Batman ever. And Joker was also best. Believe me both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are best.
"Oh boy.. there's a reason why this movie is so popular. IT'S BRILLIANT!

Remarkable acting, Heath Ledger's performance as Joker felt so realistic, I totally enjoyed the chemistry between Joker and Batman in this movie.

What I didn't like was : how Harvey got his scars..it felt kinda rushed, and the shaky cam is still there, not so prominent as Batman Begins, but still.."
"Just watched the batman, and i had to go back to a movie actually worthy of praise.

Everything about the dark knight is just great. How the shots was made, the music, the tone of the movie and the underlying story/motive."
"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out."
"A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience."
One of my ten favorite films of 2008. Great cast. Oldman deserved an Oscar nomination. The Dark Knight is perhaps the most modern comic blockbuster has given us
"This film didn't spook me when i was young, now with my adult brain, this film is super intense and psychological. The most amazing part is, it's never boring. I didnt check my phone like i usually do. This film made me jump, i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans off...Very good film. Better than no way home. Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me. And I LOVED IT SO MUCH."
"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding."
Everything in this movie is perfect. Joker (Heath ledger ) nailed it. I love the cinematography. And nolans directing.
"I dont have one complaint about this movie. I could watch it every day. Has the perfect amount of action, comedic relief, suspense and drama. Will always be a 10/10 from me."
"This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created. Meticulously plotted, boldly directed, emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking. Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass, screen devouring performance. Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are also incredible.

You need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime - go see it now!!"
"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre."
ONE OF BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!! 4K MUST HAVE!!!!
"The Best Joker ever, just legendary Amazing Extraordinary Complex Dark"
"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."
"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth."
"I'll grant that you have to be fairly intellectual to understand this movie, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless.

Heath Ledger is incredible, probably the greatest acting performance ever from a single actor.

I feel like the intellectual part comes in when you try to understand the characters. I have read other reviews saying that the joker made no sense, but in truth, the darker you think of him, the more sense he makes.

""Plotholes"" are also very easily ""filled"" when paying attention to the film."
An excellent movie with an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker
"A perfectly made movie, with Heath Ledger at his best. Batman Begins started the trend of 'dark/serious' movies, and just when you thought a movie couldn't be better... The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger.

As much as you hate the Joker character in the movie, in the end you truly feel bad. Every scene he's in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV, it's really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something else!

Sadly The Dark Knight Rises wasn't that great, this movie still stands as one of the best movies out there."
"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.

The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.

I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.

The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.

So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

Grade: A"
"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!"
"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.

I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.

But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.

Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.

Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight."
"I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle, Australia(15/7/08), let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008.

Every performance in this movie is just fantastic, and Heath Ledger Owns The JOKER, I don't think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is in.

This has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed, this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original.

Make 2008 the year to see and enjoy one of the years best.

And i hope in Feb 09, Heath is nominated for an Oscar, he will always be remembered Cheers"
"To all the moronic parents who brought their children to this film and complain about it 'not being for kids' and that your 'kids will have nightmares for weeks', here's a clue - it's PG13; and if the voluminous (that means lots of) marketing (this means the advertisements you see on TV and in your People Magazine) isn't enough to give you an idea that this isn't a family superhero movie with a funny clown, then you have nobody to blame than your own dumb self.

The sooner you wake up and pay attention to what you're feeding your children, the sooner the rest of the world can move on without hearing you blame others for your own ineffective (this means dumb) parenting."
"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.

What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.

Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.

Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.

The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.

The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.

For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes."
"Great and worth to watch, The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made."
I love batman he's basically the father I never had.
"Whenever i watch this film, it takes me to another level of creativity. Movie makes me more powerful than ever."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.

Opposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.

But ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.

Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth."
"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.

It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.

The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.

I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).

Final score: 9/10."
"I am not a huge Batman fan. But I finally watched this like 8 years later ... I was hoping for Darker, but for a Batman movie it was action packed. It was like Point Break in Gotham but was entertaining. Ledger was good but not the hype performance everyone freaked about. Good Joker, but he didn't scare me. I want joker to creep me TF out and fear his wrath. OH well. Good movie, totally worth watching. I think Bale is a good Batman but I really like Keaton. I wonder what a new Tim Burton remake would look like with all of the CGI available now that was not around when he made the first Batman with Keaton. I say we petition that. Get Burton on another, really dark one. But please, please, please. No Ben Afleck!

Happy Watching!"
"OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?"
This tital was my good tital wish if i would be like the confidently directed with a complex story.
I've lost count of how many times i have watched this. Returned to it after watching Joker. Different interpretation but Ledger's Joker is perfection
Joker was absolutely amazing! Simply a must see film for anyone who wishes to see the best joker performance.
"Absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen. The Joker and Batman fantastically portrayed by Heath and Christian with phenomenal chemistry between the characters. Over a decade on since it was released and countless superhero watched by myself since and this is still definitely the best one out there. The depth and rationalities the joker gives leave the viewer wondering whether he is crazy or completely sane in this thought provoking cinematic masterpiece.

No spoilers here but when you watch it you will be on the edge of your seat with anticipation, you will also feel so connected to both the joker and batman on an emotional level."
"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress!

As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.

I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.

This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10. Having said that, this is nothing more than 'popcorn' film."
I love it. There was so much here and I particularly loved this take on the Joker.
GREAT MOVIE. MUST SEEN. HEATH LEADGER IS INCREDIBLE CLEARLY THE BEST JOKER RIP
"Forever immortal icon Above classification level, it has a very good cast with talented acting and a talented director The movie you will never get poring of watching it.

I wish for everyone a pleasant watching."
"""The Dark Knight"" goes far beyond the label of a blockbuster or action film. Christopher Nolan crafts a powerful cinematic experience, confronting audiences with ethical and psychological dilemmas that stretch beyond the genre's conventions. Right from the start, the film challenges us to follow Batman in a struggle that goes beyond physical fights, diving deep into the dark territory of moral choices. More than a simple hero-villain face-off, Nolan shows just how much Bruce Wayne is driven-not by glory-but by a compulsive need to do what's right in a world where ""right"" is increasingly ambiguous. At its core, the film explores complex themes like sacrifice, surveillance, and the price of morality, redefining what to expect from a superhero adaptation.

The backbone of ""The Dark Knight"" is the dynamic between Batman and the Joker, portrayed iconically by Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is utterly disturbing, driven by a logic-defying impulse to expose humanity's fragility. This Joker embodies chaos in its purest form, revealing and manipulating Gotham's and Batman's vulnerabilities. More than an antagonist, he's a chaotic force that pushes Batman to question his own values, forcing him to confront the moral shadows of his own actions. The Joker imposes impossible dilemmas on Gotham and Batman alike, serving as a twisted mirror for Bruce Wayne's limitations and the clash between justice and obsession.

Christian Bale gives a gritty performance, turning Bruce Wayne into one of cinema's most complex characters. Instead of a perfect hero, his Batman is a man exhausted, torn between his commitment to protect Gotham and the personal toll of that mission. Bale brings a physicality to the role, using a raspy, intense voice under the cowl to express Batman's psychological weight. He masterfully balances the carefree playboy persona with the brooding vigilante, underscoring that Bruce is as masked in public as he is in the cape. In his interactions with the Joker, Bale conveys a complex mix of anger, frustration, and vulnerability, making him a powerful hero who struggles and wears down like anyone in Gotham. Bale's raw authenticity makes his Batman unforgettable, pushing beyond the superhero archetype into a movingly human portrayal.

The urban setting of Gotham becomes another main character, with a darkly realistic design heightened by cinematography that avoids over-the-top visuals while retaining the city's oppressive identity. Gotham is a battlefield where fear and corruption touch every scene, reflecting the complex morality of its residents. Each shot is carefully crafted to create a space where Batman is a dark vigilante and paradoxically vulnerable, as if the very place constantly reminds him of the impossibility of eradicating evil completely. Nolan makes Gotham a believable city where heroism meets real-world barriers, adding to the thick, intense atmosphere throughout the film.

Bruce Wayne's moral journey is heightened when he sees hope in Harvey Dent, believing him capable of carrying the weight of justice without turning to darkness. Aaron Eckhart plays Dent with idealistic energy that slowly breaks under pressure and tragedy, showing the fall of a ""White Knight"" into a haunting Two-Face. The story carefully parallels Dent's downfall with Batman's sacrifices, suggesting that even the purest heroes can be corrupted by pain and loss. This duality between Bruce and Dent deepens the story, and instead of simplifying the hero-villain theme, it builds complex characters who shift between light and shadow, highlighting the real cost of justice.

Nolan boldly takes on contemporary ethical questions, like surveillance and power boundaries, exploring just how far security can justify the loss of privacy. Batman's use of mass surveillance technology to catch the Joker raises the ends-versus-means debate. This decision creates one of the movie's most crucial conflicts, with Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) acting as a moral compass, challenging Batman's methods. The clash between safety and ethics lends the film a relevance that resonates beyond fiction, sparking reflections on society and the role of power in protection or oppression. Nolan's choice to include this conversation elevates ""The Dark Knight"" from action flick to critical commentary, raising questions that stick with viewers.

Technically, the film is flawless, with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enriching the atmosphere with tension and emotional depth. The sound design is especially effective in Joker scenes, marked by a sharp, ominous sound that builds sinister anticipation before he even speaks. The action scenes, executed with realism and precision, are dynamic and visually impactful without overshadowing the plot or characters, always advancing the story. Nolan strategically uses every technical element to heighten the narrative, immersing viewers in Bruce Wayne's moral struggle-a vigilante constantly torn between his principles and actions.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" transcends the superhero genre by diving into themes of morality, sacrifice, and humanity's darker side. Nolan drives a narrative that challenges audiences to see beyond the battle of good versus evil, questioning the cost of being a hero in a world where justice and ethics often clash. Batman's final image, bearing Gotham's sins and fading into the shadows, is one of cinema's most iconic and melancholy shots, capturing the weight of his burden and the complexity of his role. Ultimately, the film stands as a masterpiece that redefines genre expectations, leaving a lasting mark on both superhero films and the cinematic landscape."
"He really makes this movie. His joker is iconic truly a bar to reach for, for all other actors."
Heathe Leadger the best interpretation in the world
"In The Dark Night Movie, Joker in this movie is really a legend, He is my favorite Character in this movie, more then the Hero. The Hero is the Batmen but most famous character is the joker, the way he presents his character is mind blowing, i always gonna miss his acting, i wish he is alive so i can see him in more movies and more shades of characters. Batmen is a Super hero but Joker is a Super Villain of all time. Nolan is a great filmmaker who knows the core of emotions and character design, his script and dialogues are amazing, he is one of the best filmmaker of this century. Many filmmakers learn filmmaking from his style."
"when I gave my opinion with 9 marks ,I was not give it for the movie or for Christian Bale or for director but only for Heath Ledger who made A wonderful performance,he was able to delve deeper into this character ,really with loud voice and A great honor I want to say BRAVOOOOOOO!!! But in general the story was amazing especially in last minutes,and as always Morgan Freeman Was scintillating ,and Maggie Gyllenhaal also. finally I believe that without Heath Ledger and his performance this movie was not take more than 6 because he was the secret of success. thanks Heath Ledger and we will not forget you and your fantastic performance..."
"Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife.

Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise.

What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit.

Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here."
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.

That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.

Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.

3/10"
"If you're interested in acting, filmmaking or movies... this is one of the greatest examples of all of that. Whole Nolan's trilogy is masterpiece. But this second movie is probably the greatest one of them."
"All you need to do is switch this film on for 30 seconds, and your hooked. Simple"
"The movie showed how a real villain can cause this much chaos to the city. And how he really pushed Batman to his edge, yet not all of them are strong like Batam as some crossed the line. The best movie that shows the two iconic figures Batman and Joker rival together."
Heath Ledger will forever be the best joker ever!!! and christian bale was a decent batman in my opinion.
"Iconic! ""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre. Released in 2008, this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances. At its core, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's posthumous Academy Award-winning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist, making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchy.

Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, brings a brooding intensity that complements the film's exploration of duality and morality. Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself. The cinematography, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, adds layers of tension and depth to the narrative.

""The Dark Knight"" transcends the typical superhero narrative, evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism. The film's social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout, challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally. As the capstone of Nolan's Batman trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a high standard with its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and cinematic brilliance.

This film isn't just a comic book adaptation; it's a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable, and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers, setting a standard that few have matched. ""The Dark Knight"" remains a beacon of excellence, reminding us that a superhero film can be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern filmmaking."
"This movie is very blockbuster of Christopher nolan and i like this movie so much. And, this movie, everybody like this because, christian bale nailed it in this movie and its better than robert pattison's movie named 'batman'. Some scenes in this movie is mind-blowing and crazy, i really like this movie. The villain in this character is very fantastic and awesome role-play of villain. And im giving this movie as 10/10. Christopher nolan choose the right character of hero and im surprised and everyone in youtube got viral and lots of moments and everybody should watch this movie, its very amazing."
Hands Down this is the greatest Superhero movie of all time Better than any marvel movie The best Batman Best Joker Best Harvey Dent/Two Face Heath Ledgers performance as the joker was just epic.
"Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.

As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.

Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.

Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.

And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.

The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.

But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.

So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger."
"i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10."
"""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic masterpiece that redefines the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's direction masterfully weaves a gripping narrative filled with moral complexity and intense action. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary; he embodies chaos with chilling charisma and depth, creating an iconic villain that lingers long after the credits roll. The film's exploration of duality, justice, and sacrifice resonates deeply, making it a profound experience. With stunning visuals, a haunting score, and unforgettable performances, ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a flawless triumph in filmmaking that elevates both its characters and its themes to unforgettable heights."
"This is one of those movies that you must watch it with one sit from the beginning to the end without making you lose any interest in it. I also watched the continuation of this movie it wasn't bad at all, there are few movies which i like to watch with one sit and they are really few i personally don't really like superhero movies that much but this one really got my attention i mean it has Christian Bale (Batman) in it of course it was going to be a really enjoying movie i recommend to anyone who have not watched the movie to see it really is an impressive one really sad that we can not have a joker like this one anymore i mean Heath Ledger (Joker) really hit that high joker performance he was and still is for me the best joker in a batman movie."
"The only superhero movie that can call itself a masterpiece. A film about good and evil, anarchy and authoritarianism, supposed order and chaos. Two sides of the same coin, two weights of a scale, if one of them is missing, the other cannot exist."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends intense action, profound storytelling, and unforgettable performances. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of mesmerizing, elevating the film to unparalleled heights. Nolan's direction, coupled with Hans Zimmer's iconic score, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that captivates audiences from start to finish. The film's exploration of morality and the complexities of heroism cements its status as a modern masterpiece in the superhero genre.

Nolan's visionary storytelling and Bale's compelling Batman make ""The Dark Knight"" a timeless masterpiece."
", yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Heath ledgers character, the joker is phenomenal. One of the best acting performances ever. The dark night is a great movie, but not the best. Not in the top 25. It's Avery good movie with a thrilling story but it is a bit overrated. This movie never really gets old. And the story of heath ledger and the joker role pushing his mental state further. Heath ledger unfortunately killed himself after the role. Don't get me wrong, the dark knight is a great, excellent movie but it shouldn't be the top 3 of the world, even nearly the top 10. But the dark knight is the best sequel for a Christopher Nolan movie ever. Thank you Christopher Nolan for making the greatest superhero movie of all time."
"This is a movie which deserves more than review. O ly two word enough to explain : Almost Perfect

The job is perfect you can see the sweet of cristopher nolan in the every part of movie. There is a huge work behind this masterpiece. It has a well originated story and it has been empowered with the top class acting.

Best batman casting so far.

It is the best till the nolan decide to direct better batman movie."
Great superhero movie.I think this is the best Batman movie that has been created so far. The leading actor who plays the Joker is believe-able and draws you into the movie. The storyline was well put together and award worthy.
"After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie.

Man was i disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.

Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.

But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.

Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.

There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.

All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy.

It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.

Happy to share my feel about this movie,

Realkane"
"This movie is like a rollercoaster, the acting of Heath Ledger elevates the movie but Bale doesn't dissapoint no one is bad, the action is sooo gooooddd you can't even blink in this movie, the duo of Batman & Joker is so well crafted, it's an antagonist-protagonist relation that develops both, especially the protagonist. The ending is absolutely peak it gives you that sour felling but also hopeful, just absolutely peak but you should watch Batman Begins first it's possible to enjoy The Dark Knight without watching it but with Begins it's even better.

Conclusion: Watch it its peak absolutely peak."
"Christian bale was great acting as Batman . However , Heath ledger performance as joker is a masterpiece no one will ever top him deserved.

Rip Heath ledger greatest performance in film history."
"Although the Batman is not longer young, he can change the world to become better. I am looking forward to the next one, next fantastic one."
"The only negative I could give this movie is that the protagonist overshadows the main role of hero. After all, it is a batman movie. But lets face it, of all the good actors in the movie, Heath Ledger blows everyone away with his role of the joker. Not just for this movie, but this may be one of the best acting roles in history. The performance of his life. ( no pun intended ). Its a shame he died, there were more great performances in him, sadly we will never see. It would be a reasonable supposition to believe that ledger's performance may have been so extreme and brilliant due to psychological issues he was experiencing at the time which ultimately took his life. A candle burning too bright and will be missed."
"Christopher Nolan, Heath Ledger outstanding combo -plus christian Bale is amazing but the villain stole the light, and took a standing ovation by the world. Joker is the real trump card of this movie and the best until now."
"Oh, what a film! 🦇🌑 This movie is a towering achievement in the superhero genre, pushing the boundaries of storytelling and redefining what a comic book adaptation can be. Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a dark and gritty atmosphere that perfectly complements the complex themes explored in the film. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is truly mesmerizing and unforgettable, earning him a posthumous Academy Award. The film's thought-provoking exploration of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism makes it a standout in the genre. It's a must-watch for any fan of superhero movies or thrilling, thought-provoking cinema. Don't miss out on this epic Batman adventure! 🦇🌟"
"Feel that this movie is simply beautiful, I don't mind the fact that it is long, about 2 and a half hours?, but what if it is the perfect movie from experience, I went to see it at the cinema, and since then I have seen few Sometimes so as not to get bored with her, but I remember her as a damn exam man, and as Gordon says at the end, he's a hero, but that we don't need now, ...... the Dark Knight, ufff and that soundtrack , papa buenisimooooo, and finally, ... HE IS BATMAN."
"Title: ""A Cinematic Triumph: 'The Dark Knight' Reimagines Batman Like Never Before""

Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Released in 2008, this film marked a pivotal moment in the superhero genre, forever changing the way audiences perceive not only Batman but also the entire genre itself. With a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, unforgettable performances, and groundbreaking visuals, ""The Dark Knight"" remains an iconic achievement.

At its core, ""The Dark Knight"" is a crime drama wrapped in the guise of a superhero movie. Unlike its predecessors, this installment presents Batman as a complex vigilante facing moral dilemmas rather than a mere caped crusader fighting crime. Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delivers a mesmerizing performance. His portrayal is a perfect blend of brooding intensity and vulnerability, allowing the audience to empathize with the inner turmoil of the character.

However, the true standout performance in ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's take on the iconic Batman villain is nothing short of extraordinary. His Joker is an agent of chaos, a sadistic and unpredictable force who challenges Batman both physically and philosophically. Ledger's commitment to the role is palpable, and he disappears into the character, leaving the audience in awe of his magnetic and chilling performance. It's no exaggeration to say that Ledger's Joker is one of the most iconic and memorable villains in cinematic history.

The supporting cast also shines in their respective roles. Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon is the moral compass of Gotham City, and Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is a charismatic district attorney whose transformation into Two-Face is both tragic and compelling. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine bring depth and wisdom to their characters, providing the emotional grounding needed amidst the chaos.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a dark and gritty Gotham City that feels both hauntingly realistic and heightened in its cinematic grandeur. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and shot, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding intensity of Batman's world. Nolan's use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds a tangible weight to the film's action, making every punch and explosion feel real.

One of the most remarkable aspects of ""The Dark Knight"" is its exploration of complex moral themes. The film delves into questions of justice, morality, and the nature of heroism. Batman's ethical code is put to the test as he faces the Joker's nihilistic philosophy. The film challenges the audience to consider the cost of heroism and the blurred line between hero and villain.

In addition to its thematic depth, ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterclass in storytelling. The script, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a taut and intelligent narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene building upon the last, leading to a breathtaking climax that will leave you breathless.

Hans Zimmer's score is another element that elevates ""The Dark Knight"" to a cinematic tour de force. The hauntingly beautiful music underscores the emotional beats of the film, heightening the tension and drama. Zimmer's use of recurring motifs, such as the Joker's theme, adds a layer of psychological depth to the characters.

It's worth noting that ""The Dark Knight"" is not a typical superhero film. It transcends the genre by delivering a mature and thought-provoking narrative that appeals to a broad audience. While it contains thrilling action sequences and epic battles, it also explores the human side of its characters, making it a character-driven drama that just happens to involve superheroes.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that redefined the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance as the Joker, and the film's exploration of complex moral themes all contribute to its status as a modern classic. It's a film that continues to resonate with audiences and stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in cinema. Whether you're a fan of Batman or simply a lover of great filmmaking, ""The Dark Knight"" is a must-see that will leave you pondering its themes long after the credits roll."
"Spectacular and entertaining but no more than that.

Batman Begins is way better. This movie has nothing to add that movie and/or original story.

Be honest! What do you remember about this movie, a week after seeing it? Just the Joker walking out the exploding hospital I guess.

Nicely done but not ""Nolan proof"". Please don't make a third one Christopher (you're still one of my favorite directors).

Summary: go see it for it's spectacular actions and... that's it.

Nothing more! (sorry)

This is the required 10th line"
"Amazing movie by Nolan, could not make a more real version of Bats and Joker"
"For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

excellent movie ever! the ""joker"" character was outstanding! the heath ledger gives excellent performance in this movie,and the best music work by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard,this is a blockbuster movie of 2008.GENIUS AT WORK by Christopher Nolan.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a MASTERPIECE 10 of 10 stars."
This Movie for sure made me see batman in a different light after all he is a human and has no super powers but it just shows that you don't need super powers to be a super hero. I really liked the action in this particular film compared to the other batman films Christan Bale did a great job as batman and is possibly my preferred batman overall in the batman series. Pretty soon the new batman vs Superman will be coming out although I myself am not really a D.C fan I am definitely going to be seeing that after I watch Marvels Captain America World At War maybe after seeing Batman V.S Superman I may convert into a D.C fan and after seeing pictures of the movie that is a very likely chance
"""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a monumental achievement in superhero cinema, transcending the genre to tell a gripping, morally complex story that goes far beyond the origins of the comic book. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is not just a sequel to ""Batman Begins"", but a cinematic masterpiece in its own right.

Nolan's direction is masterful, interweaving intricate storylines with breathtaking action sequences and moments of profound introspection. The film's visual palette is dark and gritty and perfectly captures the menacing atmosphere of Gotham City.

""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero film, but a cinematic epic that transcends the boundaries of its genre. With its unforgettable cast, gripping story and thematic depth, it remains a timeless classic that has captivated audiences worldwide."
""" You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain""

Opening with a cunning master-show; a blisteringly devious bank heist that gives us the most iconic villain ever to grace the screen. A creepy Glasgow smile that keeps us up at night, spooking, haunting and endlessly projecting in our psyches for years and years, echoing from generation through generation. Everything holds up so well, in fact too well. The Dark Knight is a monolithic milestone of vigilante epicness, a hard-boiled crime noir masquerading as a PG-13 superhero movie, and a heroic ode for the ages.

Clap, Clap, Clap (in Joker's manner) for Nolan's ballistic nihilism, no holds barred mannerism and his spectacular vision has bequeathed us with multiple moral time-bombs, finely-tuned characterizations and dynamically explosive set-pieces: fake Batmans sequence, Harvey vs Rachel, 18-wheeler truck spinning and flipping upside down and Joker's brazenly blasting at the Batpod and so on. The villains have largely overpowered our hero in this one as darkness triumphantly cloaks up daylight, subverting the very foundation of comic-book genre, showing something we haven't seen before.

Similar to that magic pencil, The Dark Knight is relentless with its freakishly brutal power, casting an Abracadabra that's capable of knocking you out, mind-blown and ice cold on the floor. Dark and somber but equally rich in aesthetics, rainy Gotham City is as beautiful as it is immersive. So bleak there's almost no hope left and tensions are boisterously fueled by atmospheric dangers looming near, mercilessly raising the stakes up to 10000 degrees Celsius blazing fire. With many maze-like twists possessing such unpredictable nature similar to its crazy antagonist(s), this showdown is twistedly deranged, exciting and tragic in equal measures.

A film, so monumental, its impact cannot be understated. A film as bold and as ever-lasting as the immortal name it so tragically tells the story of.

An untouchable piece of fiction that brings great life to decades of graphic novel story-telling in unfathomably ground-breaking fashion. This is the power of undisputed directing champ Christopher Nolan.

He's Not Our Hero.

He's A Silent Guardian.

A Watchful Protector.

A Dark Knight."
Greatest superheroes film. Forever film for all time.
"""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's direction, coupled with Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, delivers a dark and gripping narrative. The film's intense action sequences, moral complexity, and stellar performances, especially by Christian Bale as Batman, make it a timeless classic. Hans Zimmer's haunting score adds to the tension, creating an immersive experience. ""The Dark Knight"" stands out as one of the greatest superhero films, offering a compelling storyline, complex characters, and a perfect balance of darkness and heroism."
"I really enjoyed this movie. Plot, cast, production... everything is on point. If you haven't seen The Dark Knight, you should. Some say its overrated.. no its not! It deserves its rating and its rank in the top rated IMDB movies of all time."
"The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.

Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.

On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.

And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.

To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it should've borrowed)."
"That's really oOosm 🔥 the acting of joker is op level. His performance made us fall in love & changed people's thought about villian. Unfortunately, he passed away before releasing of the film... It's too sad because we could have watched him making another great movies and also gathering fame, popularity .. .. .. .. .. . . . ."
"I watched alot of other batman movies, especially the newest batman.

I still have to say that no one can beat the class of christian Bale.

I love it so much and i have watched it again and again."
"There is a reason i gave this movie a 10 out of 10! There is nothing to improve upon, such a classic and a fun time to watch it even more than once!"
"This was a near-perfect masterpiece, it's what Marvel wishes it could do. The movie had tons of action scenes and a great storyline, it had the best Joker of all time. Ledger's approach to Joker wasn't the corny 1900s Joker, where he was making corny cartoon jokes. Ledger's joker was a psychological joker, that messed with people's minds and had them looking in every which direction. Bale was phenomenal, he was an incredible Bruce Wayne, was disappointed that the original Rachel dropped the movie though. It was an amazing experience to watch this movie. 10/10 would recommend anyone to watch this movie, if they would like to be entertained for 2.5 hours, it's worth it.

RIP: Health Ledger, you were gone too soon."
"The world of superheroes has always been captivated by larger-than-life characters, but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight. Batman, a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures, has been brought to life in various mediums, but with the latest film, it's clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen. The 2023 Batman film, directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher, is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen before.

For someone like me, whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics, this film was a thrilling revelation. I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman: The Animated Series and various comic books. However, seeing Batman in a live-action setting, enhanced by state-of-the-art visual effects (VFX), was a game-changer. The film takes the character's appeal and magnifies it, creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunning.

The supporting cast is equally impressive. Selina Kyle, portrayed by a charismatic actress, embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman. Her chemistry with Batman is palpable, and their dynamic adds depth to the story. The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler, played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character. The way the Riddler's elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery. Whether you're a long-time Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, this film is a must-see. Batman's legend has never shone brighter on the silver screen."
This movie is one of the greatest films of all time.It show so much symbolic messages and examples of morality that represents America in 2008.
"""Batman"" isn't a comic book anymore. Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That's because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree ""Iron Man,"" redefine the possibilities of the ""comic-book movie.""

""The Dark Knight"" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.

The key performance in the movie is by the late Heath Ledger, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since Peter Finch? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928). His clown's makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (Christian Bale), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.

Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. ""The Dark Knight"" slips around those defenses and engages us.

Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.

The plot involves nothing more or less than the Joker's attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batman' secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesn't know Batman's identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isn't the usual jabs and jests we're familiar with: It's psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on ""Memento"") has more depth and poetry than we might have expected."
This film is a definitive 10/10 no doubts about it.
"Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: ""you're not The Devil, you're practise"" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.

That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.

In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's ""white knight"", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's ""dark"" but is just different in technique and characteristics.

Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.

Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down."
"In the realm of superhero movies, there exists a pinnacle of excellence that stands head and shoulders above the rest: Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Released in 2008, this film not only redefined the genre but also transcended it, delivering a gripping narrative, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide. As an ardent fan of The Dark Knight, I am thrilled to share my enthusiastic review of this cinematic masterpiece.

From the moment the opening scene unfolds, The Dark Knight captivates viewers with its atmospheric cinematography and haunting score. Nolan's Gotham City is a gritty and realistic backdrop, evoking a sense of urban decay and moral ambiguity. This serves as the perfect setting for the complex character dynamics that drive the story forward.

At the heart of The Dark Knight lies the conflict between the iconic hero Batman, portrayed with unparalleled gravitas by Christian Bale, and his enigmatic adversary, the Joker, brought to life in a chillingly mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary, as he embodies the chaotic nature of the character with an intensity and unpredictability that is both captivating and unnerving. Every scene featuring the Joker crackles with tension, as he challenges Batman's moral code and pushes him to his limits.

But The Dark Knight is not merely a showdown between hero and villain; it is a deep exploration of the nature of heroism, justice, and the human psyche. The film delves into complex themes such as morality, sacrifice, and the blurred line between good and evil. Batman, burdened by the weight of his crusade against crime, must confront the darker aspects of his own identity as he battles against the Joker's nihilistic worldview.

One of the most compelling aspects of The Dark Knight is its examination of the concept of chaos versus order. The Joker represents pure chaos, an agent of anarchy who seeks to disrupt the established order and expose the hypocrisy of society. In contrast, Batman embodies the ideal of order and justice, striving to uphold a sense of morality and stability in the face of chaos. The dynamic between these two opposing forces drives much of the film's narrative tension, culminating in a series of gripping confrontations that challenge both characters on a fundamental level.

Beyond its thematic depth, The Dark Knight also excels in its technical craftsmanship. Nolan's direction is masterful, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and suspense. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and adrenaline-fueled, showcasing Batman's prowess as a formidable crimefighter. The film's visual effects are seamlessly integrated, immersing viewers in the dark and brooding atmosphere of Gotham City.

Furthermore, The Dark Knight boasts a stellar supporting cast, including standout performances from Aaron Eckhart as the idealistic district attorney Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as the steadfast Commissioner Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as the wise and resourceful Lucius Fox. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their respective roles, adding layers of complexity to the film's ensemble cast.

As a fan of The Dark Knight, I am continually impressed by its enduring legacy and cultural impact. More than a decade after its release, the film remains a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Its themes of heroism, sacrifice, and the struggle for justice are as relevant today as they were upon its initial release.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight stands as a shining example of cinematic excellence, a film that transcends the confines of its genre to deliver a powerful and thought-provoking experience. From its gripping storyline to its unforgettable performances, Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of the superhero mythos. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, The Dark Knight is essential viewing for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking."
"""The Dark Knight"" is, without a doubt, a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's second installment in the Batman trilogy takes everything that made ""Batman Begins"" great and cranks it up to an entirely new level.

First and foremost, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. His performance is haunting, mesmerizing, and unforgettable. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, and his ability to channel the character's madness is truly remarkable. It's a performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Batman, bringing depth and complexity to the role. The film's exploration of Batman's moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between heroism and vigilantism add a layer of sophistication to the character.

The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, all deliver outstanding performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart from other superhero movies is its gritty and realistic portrayal of Gotham City. Nolan's direction and use of practical effects create a visually stunning and immersive world that feels tangible and lived-in.

The film's themes of chaos, morality, and the consequences of one's actions are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters make for a compelling and complex story that keeps you engaged from start to finish.

Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score is pulse-pounding and adds to the tension and excitement of the film's action sequences.

""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a dark and gripping crime drama that explores the darkest corners of the human psyche. It's a film that challenges the audience to think and leaves a lasting impact. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this cinematic masterpiece."
"The Dark Knight is a trilogy movie that I watch and re watch a lot of times. Full of action, great cinematography, amazing pacing on the editing side and storytelling wise is just flawless. I can say that my favorite of the 3 is the second one with Joker, just amazing.

For me the best Batman out there."
After seeing the dark Knight thousand time I think this movie is Great it's been more than 10 years was made this movie but until now I see how great it is not because how good is Heath Ledger in joker character but the action scene was really good and how they film it.
"""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre and stands as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this film is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's portrayal of the iconic villain is nothing short of mesmerizing. He completely disappears into the character, delivering a chilling and unforgettable performance. Ledger's Joker is chaotic, unpredictable, and utterly compelling. His every scene is a masterclass in acting, and it's no surprise that he posthumously won an Academy Award for his role.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Bruce Wayne/Batman. His brooding intensity and unwavering commitment to the role make him one of the most compelling Batman interpretations to date. Bale's dedication to his craft is evident in every scene, and he brings a complex depth to the character.

Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent/Two-Face is another standout performance. His transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful and disfigured villain is handled with nuance and skill. It's a tragic arc that adds emotional weight to the film.

The film's screenplay, penned by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. It weaves together multiple plot threads, themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, and the pacing is impeccable."
Acting is perfect! Storyline is fantastic! Overall an incredible instalment in the Batman trilogy!
Best movie ever. Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......
"This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"
"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist. Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.

This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger."
"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"
"Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can't see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.

You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It's a better film than this. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....

This may be the best Batman film we've seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn't move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn't a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn't been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?"
"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.

Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.

Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
"This film is not the masterpiece that IMDb seems to assign it as. No doubt it's good, especially the tension and the performance of Heath Ledger, but I never saw it as amazing. It's far too long and there are plot holes large enough to drive the school bus through."
"*level of enjoyment* #10 top tier - from start to finish The Dark Knight has you on the edge of your seat, enjoying every minute

*likelihood to recommend* #10 highest recommendation - if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is a masterpiece, the downside? likely to put all future Batman features to shame

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

*quality of intangibles* #8 excellent - visual is on point, dark gloomy Gotham, perfect setting for a hero to operate and succeed from the shadows very good - music and sound puts viewers in the mood and anticipating the next intense scene"
The dark knight is the best movie I have ever seen in my life
"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
"This is the best superhero movie ever made!!!! If you like to watch superhero movies then you should definitely watch this.

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best."
"The actors, the script, the scenery make it one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best-played character of the joker is amazing. That's how I imagined him. In the film, he is portrayed as an ultra-intelligent person with a psychopathic ""brain"". Honestly, I was very surprised that someone known for their niche productions would play such a good role as one of the most important characters in the Batman series. Unfortunately, we will probably never see the joker so well again, because Heath Ledger, from unknown circumstances, died. This is sad news. However, back to the movie. The main character, Batman, played by Christian Bale, also shows the character very well. Therefore, my rating for this movie is 10/10."
"When I went to the cinema to see Indiana Jones 4 I remember seeing a trailer for 'The Dark Knight'. It was dark, full of explosions and looked really cool. Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.

Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.

Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.

And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.

The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time."
"What can I say, it was made by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good. Amazing action. Amazing characters. Amazing director. And amazing cinematography. The Dark Knight has everything. And like everyone said, Heath Ledger had a performance of a lifetime. This movie is just absolutely great.

Overall rating: 9.4."
There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
"I will say up front that I have never seen a movie based on a comic book that I really liked, except the animated ones, or the quasi-animated, like _Sin City_. You would think the graphic novel and film would have a lot in common, but in the end they're trading in different kinds of images.

This is basically just another Batman movie. Same silly premise, that a super-rich hero battles --- over the shrinking remnants of Gotham city --- villains with seemingly unlimited resources in personnel and explosives.

I will agree that Heath Ledger's performance is amazing. Can this be the same guy who played the gay cowboy in that other movie? It is a real pity that he died. I can't help but thinking that if he were still alive, and we were wondering what he would do next with his great talent, this movie would not have an average rating of 9.0 (as of this writing).

There are a lot of other fine actors (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, for crying out loud) who are basically wasted pretending to take their characters seriously.

I did like the heist sequence at the beginning, including the Joker's first few lines and the bit with the bus. Really very droll; gets your hopes up. But, from then on, it's just a lot of people being blown up while the survivors emote angst --- dark, brooding, comic-book angst."
"Incredibly beatiful.

Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Eric Roberts and Cillian Murphy. Amazing cast! Thanks to writers Jonathan Nolan and Cristopher Nolan for screenplay and Cristopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for story and Bob Kane for characters. Thanks to director Cristopher Nolan."
"Fantastic, that is the only word i can use to describe how well this movie was made. This movie has everything from dark humor, action to the most dark and horrifying scenes, it is an amazing movie and i have to give credit to the amazing actor Heath Ledger, he did an amazing job in this movie and absolutely nailed the joker, he is definitely the best joker i've ever seen he did it so on point it's fantastic. Overall i think this movie is definitely Oscar worthy and it's without a doubt the best batman movie ever made!!!"
"I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.

As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.

The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.

Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.

As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip."
"There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground."
"This Is probably the second best sequel of all time, second only to the return of the king. I've seen this movie twice in cinema this year, that's just how good it is. I could name very few flaws in this movie. This movie has some of the best preformances of all time. Heath ledgers preformance is nothing short of phenomenal and arguably the best preformance we've ever been given in a superhero film. However I believe Aaron eckhart plays his role as two-face to perfection which is severely overshadowed by Heath ledgers. Definitely one of those movies you can watch numerous times. Christopher nolan is a brilliant director 10/10."
"Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic, spend a couple extra dollars and you'll get your money's worth.

This is the best movie of 2008, no other film will come close.

Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece, with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight.

The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival, The Joker. Ledger's performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen.

There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE! Even if your not a Batman fanatic, this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day, night, morning, etc.

No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledger's stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD, WATCH IT IN IMAX!"
"Heath Ledger as the Joker is brilliant, and anytime he's on the screen this action film seems elevated. It also gets the nihilistic insanity of the character right, as Alfred (Michael Caine) so correctly puts it, ""Some men just want to watch the world burn."" I was less of a fan of Christian Bale's performance as Batman, with his toneless, gruff voice, and if I'm honest, even the concept of the Dark Knight, with Batman sans Robin viewed as an evil vigilante by the citizens of Gotham. I also thought the film tried to pack too much in, with the love interest/triangle (Maggie Gyllenhaal), rise of Two Face (Aaron Eckhart), and extraneous characters (e.g. Morgan Freeman). It could have also used a breather in between all the action scenes, though some of the elements, like that batpod with the extra fat tires, were pretty cool. It goes on way too long at 152 minutes, and if it had been pared down and more focused on the Joker's sadistic psychological cruelty, could have been a masterpiece. All in all it's a good, entertaining film, but not worthy of the extraordinary high praise and ratings it's received."
"In my opinion, this movie a bit over-hyped and a bit over-rated actually. Is this movie better than 12 Angry Men or Schindler's List or The Return Of The King? Absoulutely not. Amazing acting and amazing cinematography and a very good screenplay but not good as the movies that I counted. This is a Nolan movie this can't be bad for real, this is very good actually. But I'm saying it is just not good as Godfather Part II. It's common Comic movies are over-rated sometimes but this is over-rated more with death of Heath Ledger. I think it could be highest rated super-hero movie, I'm truly okey with it, I'm just saying this should be on Top 30~ not in Top 5."
"There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It's his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it's a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That's why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.

A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath 'Joker' Ledger!

The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman's reach. And that's where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman's life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?

Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it's required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style.

The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman's grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music.

Harvey Dent's character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I'm making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences' spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says 'asta la vista' and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It's called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography.

Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 ½ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won't mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could've been shorter and some lengthier but with 'The Dark Knight' that's not the case. It's mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!

Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I'm expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead.

As I said earlier, I'm a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I'm mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I'm rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!"
"I was never much for Batman movies but Christian Bale was by far the BEST Batman EVER ,paired with Heath Ledger and the dynamic was incredible, I believe that Heath Ledger was the BEST 'Joker, and his portrayal of the Joker in the movie of the same name was sheer brilliance. The best coupling by far, in fact when I used to have my grandson over we watched Batman 'The dark night' repeatedly. Loved this movie."
"Perfect, greatest movie.. the plot, action, storyline everything is best , best"
"Heath ledger was the main thing here, perfect fit for joker, absolute crazy, yet so tricky . Best acting so far and deserved those oscar !"
"I can watch this movie an infinite number of times. It never gets old. From the perfect action scenes, epic score and iconic performances, this movie has it all. I think the performances in this movie are so underrated. Ledger's performance as joker is one of the best in cinema history. Not to mention Bale's perfect batman, Oldman's Gordon, and Caine's Alfred. I could write pages about the perfection of each scene in this movie. Every time I watch it it is like the first time, and I can not think of a better compliment."
"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.

This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.

Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
I watched the movie 10+ times and in many cases just for the soundtrack!
"Today, its ranking is #1 out of top 250 movies of all times. That is absurd. This movie is great - but by no means best movie ever. It is not a movie that revolutionizes movies as we see them. It is hard for me to imagine why someone would think this movie is better than breakthroughs like The godfather, Pulp fiction, Matrix, etc. I loved the movie - but nothing in the movie was revolutionary. The story line was not extra-ordinary. The gadgets were great but we have seen better. (sweet tires on the bat mobile + bike). Acting was great. By all means worthwhile of watching - but I am actually very disappointed to see it at #1 movie of all times"
"Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into ""The Dark Knight"" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by ""Batman Begins"" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.

Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that ""The Dark Knight"" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book ""Arkham Asylum"". Others recall ""The Killing Joke"". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.

I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.

This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in ""Begins"". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.

Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has ""The Dark Knight"" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from ""The Dark Knight"". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.

I have one or two misgivings about ""The Dark Knight"". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.

Tim Burton once said, ""Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book"". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. ""The Dark Knight"" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours ""The Dark Knight"" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."
"It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, I'm not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolan's second stab at Batman as well as Christian 'Rant' Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho' despite it's reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a 'masterpiece', 'the best movie of 2008 so far', 'far surpasses Begins'. No, it isn't and no it doesn't. All I can say is that these people have not seen many 'masterpieces' or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a 'moral dilemma' and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the 'we' being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledger's last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. It's not bad, it's not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you won't be missing much at all."
"Phenomenal. From start to finish this film is a masterpiece. It is quite possible the best all round film ever.

Action, amazing Drama, incredible Realism, believably brilliant Fantasy, works perfectly

This is a film that all should see. Performance from Christian Bale is spot on yet still over shadowed by the amazing Heath Ledger. His joker is undoubtedly the best.

The fact Christian's performance is superb and still you remember the joker, shows what a practically perfect performance they both gave. Ability to share the screen without scene stealing and just enhancing each others performances shows how great they both are.

Add in outstanding direction and the cherry is on the top. Must watch."
"When Batman Begins was released in the year 2005, I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series, that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny, playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman..

So when I went to watch this movie, I was ready to see the Heath Ledger's Joker cracking some jokes, blowing up lots of places, killing tons of people, going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings, he did kill people, he did go insane and laugh, but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it..

Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledger's Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world, put in a dark and serious movie and make it work..

Other actors also played their part well, Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully.

This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, For those of you who haven't watched it yet, I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely.."
"The phenomenal The Dark Knight reigns as the greatest superhero film of all time. From its exhilarating first frame to it's bittersweet last, among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish and the most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil. Nolan's constantly keeps us off-balance and fills us with breathless anticipation for the next stunning turn-of-events so What you finally receive from The Dark Knight, then, isn't a message but a sensation, which comes from the deliberately twisted form, you learn how it feels to be in a vortex that just keeps sucking you down. To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas. It's not just the best Batman film ever. It's not just the best superhero movie ever. It's more than a money-spinner, a franchise, a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it."
"Flat out one of the best movies I've ever watched. Had plot, action, acting, and was all put together perfectly. Christian Bale was amazing and of course Heath had one of the best acting performances of all time. Christopher Nolan is such a gifted director able to make this movie one of the best oat! A must watch!"
"From the very beginning this movie has your attention grabbed and doesn't let go until the final credits begin to roll. One of my favorite films. Even if you are not a fan of Batman or superhero movies in general, this is a movie unlike any superhero movie. With varying levels of depth, emotion, suspense, action, and amazing special effects this film stands above the rest within and without of its genre. Christopher Nolan's cinematic genius takes hold in this second installment of his Batman series. Christian Bale performs a compelling and adrenaline-pumping Batman fights opposite Heath Ledger's chilling take on The Joker. The Dark Knight hails as one of the greatest Batman films to ever grace the silver screen."
"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.

But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.

Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it.

But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
"A new force threatens Gotham City, and The Face of The Joker is always smiling.

It is almost as is Christopher Nolan cherry picked all of the best elements from The Batman backlog, I include the previous movie, The Burton years, Adam West era etc, and forged together something quite incredible, making not just The best Batman movie of all time, but arguably one of the greatest movies of all time.

Two and a half magical hours, this film excels in every conceivable field, it is wonderfully dark, atmospheric and moody, but in equal measures it is exciting, action packed and dynamic.

The story couldn't be better, it's so good, it'll appeal to those that don't even enjoy superhero movies, it really is that good. Packed with incredible action scenes, it's visually awesome.

Christian Bale is once again fabulous, this Batman is a little petulant, a little impatient, but wonderfully intense. What every hero needs though, is a villain, and what takes this film up another level, is Heath Ledger, who's remarkable performance is nothing short of astonishing.

An incredible supporting cast once again, Caine and Freeman once again show why they're Hollywood royalty.

Superior to pretty much everything else.

10/10."
"Its one od the best movies of decade,centuries and millenium! Its drama,Action,unexpected thrill that is everywhere and heath ledgers joker is unforgetable. I know you're saying that it cannot be the best and all of this stuff but WHY SO SERIOUS?"
"The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.

The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: ""I'm not wearing hockey pads!"" Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed.

The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname ""the Dark Knight"" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.

It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over the﻿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.

The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes.

The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!

The Dark Knight score: A + .

"The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.

The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much ""face time"" on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.

Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right."
"The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him, but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the film; the camera-work was excellent, the pace was gripping, the plot was thrilling and the acting was splendid. Background music also suited the atmosphere to the highest degree.

All in all, a perfect film and magnificent acting...the film should have been named after the joker...Batman himself was not needed....such a Batman film will never again be produced, due to the unfortunate absence of Heath Ledger.

10/10 rating...well done"
Heath Ledger must have put everything at stack to prepare for this kind of act. I love Christian Bale as an actor and Batman as a character but the after watching the movie must say sometimes it's villain who steal the show
"I am not a huge fan of sequels and it is hard to write a review about what I see as one of the most perfect movies I have had the privilege to see.

The Nolan brothers have done a brilliant job with this sequel to the critically acclaimed Batman Begins of 2005.

Heath Ledger as the Joker virtually steals the movie, add him to Christian Bale as Batman, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine as Alfred, then add the brilliant Morgan Freeman and the ever reliable Gary Oldman in their respective roles and you have an absolutely brilliant cast to work their magic.

I am not as eloquent as many of the reviewers on this site who have gushed superlatives about this movie in 1000 words or less, but my short review will suffice for me to get across my opinion.

If you have not already seen this movie after 9 years you have really missed out on one of the entertainment experiences of life that you could have very cheaply experienced by now.

You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this somehow and see it.

One of the easiest movies to rate 10 out of 10."
"I have the flame suit on. I've already called my lawyers. I've prepared fake passports and bought several different aliases to run by. I have also transferred my funds to a European account. Why so serious? Because, here we go, The Dark Knight is not the epic piece of Godly art that everyone is hyping it to be.

*Runs*

The Dark Knight is a good piece of work, a decent movie, but does not fall into near-perfection by any means. Despite the amazing performances, writing, and action sequences, the heart and core of the comic book flavor is severely missing. Issues from Batman Begins is carried over and repeated here, even though they aren't as easy to spot. This is much better than Begins, but still fails to totally erase the memory of Burton's vision of Batman. Resembling more The Godfather and Heat rather than a flick like Iron Man or Spider-Man, it's a totally different sort of movie involving superheroes and supervillians. Gotham City STILL doesn't truly look like Gotham City.

Starting the movie is a bank robbery unlike any other, setting the tone of the movie instantly. We see the Joker (Heath Ledger) stirring some early trouble with the mob and crime lords. We then see Batman imitators lurking about. Last, but not least, we see Bruce Wayne's ex (Maggie Gyllenhaal) around the arms of another man: Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Then running amok throughout the 150+ minutes of The Dark Knight are action sequences, plot twists, several surprises, several close calls, and a whole lot of crime drama. Good vs. Evil is a battle that is horrifically blurred, and human nature surrounding Gotham City is being tested. All the tension is overcoming Bruce Wayne and Batman, and he begins questioning his motives and placement within the city. The writing staff threw in plenty of deep and engaging dialogue amongst all the action we see on-screen. It's a Batman fan's dream come true; or is it?

We can start by crediting Heath Ledger for a fine performance as the Joker. But if Ledger deserves an Oscar for his role, so should Nicholson back in 1989, because believe there are many similarities in terms of performance. The Joker here is cynical, merciless, and is bent on anarchy for no reasonbut so was Joker in 1989. If Ledger wins the Oscar, then Jack himself should be accepting it on his behalf. Christian Bale yet again fails as Batman with his frustrating raspy voice. As Bruce Wayne he nails it, but as Batman he still needs a bit of work. When Batman starts monologing, it's hard not to cringe. The rest of the cast does a good job, most notably Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Let's also not forget Morgan Freedman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The biggest strength of the Batman universe lies within the balance of Batman and his villains. Almost all of them have some sort of connection with our hero. However, the treatment of villains yet again is disappointing, as we see a few villains limited to mere cameos, and the Joker himself (despite the trailers) does not get as much screen time as you may assume. In the infamous 1989 version, we saw the Joker rise from lowly punk criminal to a serious threat to the entire city. In the Dark Knight, unlike Batman, there is literally no explanation as to why he is the way he is. There is no backstory revealed, nothing that could possibly explain his physical appearance and mental state. Surely he may craft some tales, but why believe a madman's tale as he wields a knife to your lips?

Dark Knight's best moments were not the action sequences, but the immense tension and suspense predating the payoff .Rarely could you predict the outcomes of some of the conflicts, and for the most part all the payoffs were grand, sometimes leading to applause. The chases and action-packed moments themselves were also well-crafted and made great use of special effects. Yet with so many problems flying at you at the same time, it's impossible to expect them all to be concluded and wrapped up in the end. Nolan's direction is stunning from time to time, but then he runs out of steam towards the end of the third act, when the movie is almost finished. The ending, albeit unexpected, was a bit underwhelming and quite vague, especially considering the fact that The Dark Knight is 150 minutes long.

Bottom Line: The negativity is sprinkled about in this review, but don't let that fool you. The Dark Knight is indeed a great blockbuster flick that will have you forgetting that there's popcorn and soda by your side. From the dazzling performance of the late Heath Ledger to the carefully-constructed action sequences that keep the pace flowing, there is plenty to praise about. That being said, it's still not the best superhero movie of all-time. Batman is a comic book, and the cast of this new franchise must remember this. You can dwell as much realism as you'd like, but the fact remains that this isn't a realistic franchise nor should it ever be treated as such.

Gotham City is still missing its gritty, Gothic, dark architecture and style of Burton's films, and needs more emphasis on the villains that are in Batman's world. The villains are the ""yang"" to the Batman mythology, and Batman himself is the ""yin""; you can't have too much of one and not enough of the other. While it isn't Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four (both of them) The Dark Knight still falls short of masterpiece quality simply because of its exchange of comic book style for realistic crime drama. The Dark Knight is a great ride, but not an epic one to Quality Heaven."
"Remember those sayings that magazines or critics would say? One of the more popular ones was: ""If you only see one movie this summer, this is it"". Well, until now I never understood that too well, but now I really... really do. The Dark Knight is THAT movie. As plain as I can say it, The Dark Knight is by far the greatest, most entertaining movie released all year. Period.

I had the privilege of seeing an advanced showing for management only in IMAX about a week before this movie released. I was ecstatic that not only was I seeing this much anticipated movie a week early, but it was my first IMAX experience. If you have the option, definitely go with IMAX, it was unbelievable really. It felt like you were flying thru Gotham City about to fall into another scheme by the Joker. But enough about IMAX, how about the movie? Well, Batman Begins received exemplary ratings from critics, about an 8 out of 10 on IMDb if I recall correctly as well. Since Batman Begins turned out so well and ended with Batman receiving word of the Joker, every fan was ready for this movie ASAP. Just a short, quick, 3 years later... we finally got The Dark Knight. The main attraction for this show was Heath Ledger's part after his sudden death. Some will be saying that this was one of his best performances, and I can agree strongly. The Joker was thrilling, yet comical. Heath brought out the dark villain even though he is, well, a joker. All his phrases and sayings made the movie what it was, but it still kept your mindset in fright mode; very hard to tackle.

Looking back on every scene, noticing it was 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, I can not find a scene unnecessary. Few movies bare the exception of being insanely long but not at all boring, and this one fit that perfectly. Very long, very detailed, but with patrons paying that IMAX ticket price, you want every minute you can get. I also could not find any flaws really with the movie, except for the casting of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Anyone but Katie Holmes wouldn't be good enough. I mean, Maggie is pretty, but not nearly as good looking as Katie Holmes; sort of ruined her character for me. She is very talented though, absolutely.

So after all was said and done, this movie to me was just about perfect. 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan absolutely took Batman to a new level and said 'forget the rest'. This is top notch... I want to watch it again."
"The true way Batman was meant to be told; I think Joaquin Phoenix was a great joker, but Heath ledgers performance is unmatched and truly frightening to watch."
"Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) accords a deal with the lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and his sweetheart-assistant(Maggie Gyllenhaal) for eliminate definitively criminality at Ghotam. However , a mysterious delinquent and psychotic villain named The Joker (Heath Ledger)begins a new wave of criminal rampage and terror. Batman is only helped by his attendant named Alfred(Michael Caine) and his scientific (Morgan Freeman).

This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by violent images, thriller and breathtaking scenes with overwhelming computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , impressive fights, and breathtaking pursuits. The dark story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Batman begins (2005)¨ also directed by Christopher Nolan ; booth movies result to be an intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Christian Bale dons the suit and cape, for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Batman and he deserves credit for remaining true to character.

A well-intentioned and interesting plot by David S. Goyer based on the characters created by Bob Kane, following the events developed in Batman Begins and repeating some actors as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy , among others. Suspenseful musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard , and colorful, dark cinematography by Wally Pfister. The film takes off to provide some great moments and great fun as Superman swings into action. The picture is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan who has directed excellent movies as ¨The prestige¨, ¨Insomnia ¨ and ¨Memento¨ and is preparing Batman third part. This live action Batman was one of the highest grossing movie made in that year, as well as, Nolan's most prestigious efforts in that field. Rating : Very good. Better than average."
It's Batman Drama Apocalypso.It can't get any better.A must watch movie for all superhero movie fans! If spider-man wrecked havoc in the Hollywood industry being a superhero movie here comes a batman to challenge all the spider-man movies together at one go.Heath ledger was just outstanding and unparalleled.I don't know about posthumous but no one can do joker any better.The movie with its thrill and action was breathtaking and the dramatization and performances were power packed.You have to be a fierce and a harsh critic to find lapses and faults but i think its going to be hard for anybody to poke negative comments at it.Beautifully crafted and wonderful direction.The director should be applauded.What else can I say.I give 8 now to be safe but i'd love to give it a 9+.
My go to movie on a Friday night! Excellent all around!
"The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I'm not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot.

Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I'm not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him.

My inability to empathise with the characters wasn't helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.

The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren't enough to keep the film going.

As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn't been as good as I was hoping it would be."
"So I know I'm not supposed to dislike a movie like this especially since Heath Ledger acts so well but I've seen this film several times I've given it it's due but honestly it's not good. The Direction and acting are amazing but the plot is bad. The plot is outrageous as though the joker could accomplish even part is insane even for the comics. The phone call scene .. are u f..ing kidding me It's so outlandish that it's annoying. And the ferries !!! Common. I know it's a fantasy but the whole ""social experiment "" is so stupid. Arggg I hate this film. Nolan does an amazing job but honestly Burton runs laps on you. The vision and plot are sub par to the point of annoyance. I know everyone loved this film but honestly it's bad.really bad. Hard pass."
"I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolan's art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still haven't seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for...."
"The movie is pretty boring and bad, however the joker scenes are amazing. If the whole movie was like his scenes, I would've given it 9 stars. However, sadly, the movie is depriving us of Joker because there are only like 5 scenes with him. Batman is pretty comedic in this movie. Which is not a good thing. He is always acting serious but his voice is just, how do I say this, cringe worthy. Batman sounds like one of those kids YouTubers that make videos of Batman and Elsa hooking up (yes those videos exist, please monitor what your kids are doing/watching online). The movie ends pretty abruptly, and left me confused. (I recommend watching Joker instead)."
"I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.

The film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.

The plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.

The music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.

And I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.

There is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.

Overall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Cinematic masterpiece with a solid 10/10 rating-this movie is truly exceptional. Christopher Nolan's genius shines through, as the film expertly navigates dark tones, immersing the audience in a gripping narrative. The meticulous camera work enhances the overall experience, capturing every nuanced detail with precision. From intense action sequences to quiet moments of suspense, the cinematography is nothing short of remarkable. The actors' performances elevate the film to another level, delivering emotive and captivating portrayals that stay with you long after the credits roll. In every aspect, this movie is a testament to the artistry of filmmaking and a true masterpiece in its own right."
This is the best superhero movie i ever watched the story of the movie is to deep and mang meaning in it
Heath Ledger and Christian Bale are absolutely phenomenal in this movie.
Easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Bale isn't great as Bruce/Bat but his acting is on par. However Heath's joker isn't an Oscar legend for no reason. One of the best portrayals of a character of l time. Up there with James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.
"Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight* is not just a superhero film; it is a gripping crime drama that transcends its genre to deliver a profound narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the human condition.

The film masterfully balances action with deep character development, showcasing Batman's struggle against not only external threats but also his internal demons. The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, particularly Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker, which redefines the archetype of the villain. Ledger's Joker is chilling and chaotic, serving as the perfect foil to Batman's quest for justice.

Nolan's direction is taut, crafting a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The screenplay is sharp, blending intense action sequences with thought-provoking dialogue that raises significant ethical questions about the nature of heroism versus vigilantism.

The cinematography and score further elevate the film, with the haunting themes underscoring the emotional weight of the story. Each frame is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive experience that draws audiences into Gotham's dark underbelly.

Overall, *The Dark Knight* is a landmark in filmmaking that demands to be experienced. It is not only a thrilling ride filled with unforgettable moments but also a poignant exploration of the dichotomy between order and chaos, making it a film that resonates long after the credits roll. A true triumph in cinematic storytelling."
"This is one of the best movies which I have seen. One of the best movie in all terms. The best part was the villain's role, what a world class acting shown by the actor."
This movie will forever be my all time favorite! Not only was I living in Pittsburgh when it was being filmed.. but it was also released on my birthday! Best movie ever!
"""The Dark Knight"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic success that transcends the superhero genre, leaving a lasting mark on the world of film. Nolan masterfully weaves a complex and morally ambiguous take of chaos and order, exploring the thin line between heroism and villainy. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is legendary! He is a force of nature and added layers of depth to the character. Heath Ledger steals every scene with a magnetic presence that is both terrifying and mesmerizing. Christopher Nolan's vision, coupled with Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance makes it an instant modern classic."
"Bale gud, Heath gud Affleck bad, Pattinson bad This Best movie ever. I rate 5/7.

My favourite hobby, watching this movie n playing Arkham games.

Did I mention bale Gud?"
"When I watched the dark knight for the first time, I was about 16 and I had mixed feelings towards it, I used to consider it to be a decent film not great as at that time I was just an average movigoer. Then after two years I gave it a rewatch with full enthusiasm after 'watching and having few knowledge' about some critically acclaimed films like ""the departed"", "" Inception "" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". After my second viewing I found it to be one of the best films ever made and the best in its genre .It was a game changer for my taste in films. It still tops the superhero genre even after 14 years of it's release. The only superhero/comic book film which comes close to this one is ""Logan"" in my opinion. So after all I consider the dark knight to be a phenomenal film even without Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. The main reason for the artistic appearance of the film is because of it's exploration towards many themes like human nature, dark reality of society, nature of lies, true and false characteristics and many more. Considering other parameters like cinematography, background score and screenplay, I highly appreciate all of this especially the background score which I consider to be the best among all Nolan's films. So I end my review here, thanks for reading.

Rating - 9.6/10."
No one could create a unique Batman better than Nolan.
"Quite simply ""Dark Knight"" is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn't a ""proper"" superhero movie, so let's forget about that).

Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman's enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn't ""just"" a superhero movie. It's also a study of character, of good and of ""dark"" and of perception of ""society."" I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it's not.

Secondly, Batman doesn't do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he's flying. Look at Spiderman, he's got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That's all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn't have these ""abilities"" about him which are soooo unrealistic.

So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable.

The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman's car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!

I won't talk much about Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker. It's definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He's just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!

Everything in Dark Knight works. It's got so much novelty to it. It's a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it's for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn't for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special.

It's cool It's original It's awesome

I can't believe how it wasn't nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him"
"Batman (Christian Bale) joins force with Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who is his rival in the love for Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to fight the organized crime in Gothan City. However, chaos is installed in the city with the arrival of the sadistic psychopath The Joker (Heath Ledger) that brings a wave of violence and murders. The Joker promises to kill prominent citizens of Gothan City unless Batman discloses his identity, and tries to prove the malice and darkness of the human nature and destroy the hope of the dwellers of Gothan City.

""The Dark Knight"" is a great surprise for a blockbuster, with a solid and deep story, great direction, performances, special effects and make-up. The adventure is also dramatic, with magnificent lines and discussions about ethics, morality, human nature, hope and other important themes. The cast has great performances and Heath Ledger is excellent in the role of the psychopath The Joker, and using the movement of lips and tongue visibly inspired in T-Bag, from ""Prison Break"", and brilliantly performed by Robert Knepper. But his nomination is emotionally affected by his death. In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is a great movie, the best of the Batman franchise and one of the best of the genre in 2008, but the IMDb User Rating (Top 250: #4) is absolutely overrated, ridiculous and disrespectful with the classics of the cinema history and the credibility of IMDb's Rating; but ""sometimes the truth is not good enough"". My vote is nine.

Title (Brazil): ""O Cavaleiro das Trevas"" (""The Dark Knight"")"
"Writing this review at the tail end of opening weekend, the Dark Knight has broken the record for opening weekend and deservedly so... this film is a step-above the standard summer blockbuster. However, the film also sits atop IMDb's top 250 films of all-time list, a ranking that won't last nearly as long as its box-office rank. Lines have been long to see this film, and many of those who are voting on this opening weekend are die-hards who waited in line and were ready to love this film regardless of what it offered. Of course, the fact that this film stands alone in its genre in terms of writing, cinematography, art design, and plot helps boost its ratings into the stratosphere, but when the non die-hards begin to watch and vote, we'll see this film settle into its rightful place, somewhere in the top 25 of all time. Its one of those few films that is entertaining and accessible enough to please the same people who went out in droves for Spiderman 3, while artistic and smart enough to please the more discerning cinematic audiences. Truly disturbing, the characters were far from cliché, as one would expect from the genre. No character is all-good or all-bad. Ledger's Joker comes close, but earns a touch of sympathy. None of the heroes are flawless, which is a sign of any good film. My single complaint (besides the various hard-to-believe falls Batman survives) is the rating. This film is far-too disturbing to garner a PG13 rating, and deals with the ugliest sides of humanity in a way that should probably be accompanied by a good conversation that can add some perspective... yet another reason why this film is so good."
"And that word is Awefantaculous. I use that word because words like ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"" are thrown around way too much. This movie deserves better. Almost everything about it was perfect. I will try to give away as little about the plot as possible, because to take away anything from this experience would be disastrous. Let me just say that I was not in the least disappointed with the plot, it delivered in as many ways as seemingly possible. It improves on Begins in almost every way. What you have seen in the trailers doesn't compare to what the movie delivers. heard complaints about the run time, but that was absolutely no problem for me. Every minute of the movie was great, and I didn't think any of it was unnecessary at all. In fact the only real problem I had with the movie was the dread of knowing that the movie had to end some time. The movie was the perfect mix of the human side and the action side. It goes so much deeper than the battle against good and evil.

The acting was at the top of the ranks. Christian Bale has once again proved that he is made for the role of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Maggie Gyllenhaal served as a great replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both played their roles just as good as before, which is all anyone can really ask, is it not? I think Gary Oldman was even better as Gordan than he was in Batman Begins. Harvey Dent was played really well by Aaron Eckhart, as well. But I guess in the end what people want to know is about is how the late Heath Ledger played the Joker, easily my favourite Batman villain, and maybe my favourite villain of all. Well, he was perfect. I feel that the role will go down in history as one of the greatest villainous portrayals of all time. Give him the Academy Award and any other awards that he could possibly qualify for. Hell, invent a new category just for him. He was The Joker. May he rest in peace.

I loved the way the film was shot, whether it was the hotel scenes, the scenes of Gotham City and especially the action scenes in the movie, which I felt was another improvement made on Batman Begins. I guess you could say it was a lot more fun, since a common complaint about Begins was the lack of that. I thought the blue colour scheme of Gotham was really great. The movie also had some great wit throughout it, which rarely seemed cheesy or out of place. The score was really something as well. It is probably one of my favourite ones around. One of the best things about the film, for me, was just how dark the movie was. If Batman Begins pushed Batman and Robin to the back of your mind, then The Dark Knight will be the movie that pushes it out. The film was made to really let The Joker be what he was truly meant to be, without restraint. I am amazed that it got away with the PG-13 rating (even though I'm an Aussie, and don't have that rating system). The costumes and make-up in the movie were, big surprise, just great. I thought The Joker's makeup was really cool, because it didn't just take the easy way out and make it perfect throughout the movie. They went into detail with it. Batman's new suit was also pretty cool.

I guess in the end, all I can really say that I loved this movie, and I think it would be hard for someone to be disappointed with it. Christopher Nolan really came through big time, and made a massive improvement over the already great Batman Begins. This is clearly a franchise that fits him like a glove. It is suspenseful, emotional, action packed and really everything else I think people could hope for. A problem with the movie is that after seeing it, you may just be a little spoiled. Because it is at a level of awefantaculousness that is pretty rarely seen in movies. Believe the hype. This is way more than a Batman movie or a summer blockbuster, it is just incredible."
"First of all, no I don't think this movie is bad. But I don't think it should be thought of as the gold standart for comic book movies. Because honestly, this movie doesn't feel like a comic book.

This is a very good action movie, that dresses it's main protagonist and antagonist as comic book characters. And here I think lies the problem.

This is a movie about a billionaire, dressed as a bat, who beats an anarchist clown. And Christopher Nolan tries to make this look serious. I'm sorry, it doesn't work. It just takes away the comic book feeling. And therefore it becomes a little boring. If Heath Ledger isn't on the screen I find myself hardly invested in what's happening.

To be honest, I never really liked this movie that much. Maybe because I first watched when I was 8 and it felt boring. But I watched it a few times in later years and I still remember only pieces of fractions of what's happening, outside of scenes that have the Joker. And to be fair, I probably wouldn't have remembered those pieces, if I didn't watch reviews out of boredom.

I went online to see if there is anybody who feels the same way and they all said the same thing: Heath Ledger single handedly saves this movie. And while his performance is spectacular, I can't think of him as a definitive Joker. He is good for this movie, but I'm not sure if I can see him fit in other Batman movies. And a personal bias of mine is that no one is ever going to top Mark Hamill. However, Ledger did his own thing and he did good. Unlike other main charachters in the movie, this one won people over. But it's still in a movie that plays everything too serious.

It feels like Nolan took the main charachters from a comic book and put them in this, just because otherwise it would have been just another action movie. It lacks a certain element. It lacks that comic book campiness, that even the most serious comic books have a pinch of in them. And therefore it fails to deliver as a comic book movie.

That's not to say that being serious is a bad change. Too many comic book are corny as hell and very often it gets annoying. But if you get too serious, you get boring. One should not be at the expense of the other. One must find a balance between the comic book campiness and the seriousness of the real world.

To quote a certain character: Why so serious?"
"The Dark Knight actually got lucky. Movies over the last six years have been crap. Scripts poorly written, over budgeted for the visual effect - yet not transferring well to the big screen, bad story ideas, copy cats of other films,lack of creativity, films that hold vulgarity and violence as a high standard of film making. That's what we've had over the years. Now comes Batman - Dark Knight. Which is written well enough but whose aim isn't good story telling. It's written to move about from pointless spot to pointless spot until you reach the end. Why another Batman Joker movie? It's been done already.

It has a mindless assembly-line quality to it as each scene is repeated over and over during the 2 1/2 hours of this film. The scenes are different only by location and a few faces. Something bad happens, the joker appears, Batman appears. Then the joker disappears and Batman disappears. Over and over and over again.

The other big comment people had made about this movie is that it is very dark. Like that's a good thing. I don't get it. Maybe because I've had too many real life experiences that were truly dark. Motion pictures trying to have this quality and then for others to celebrate this seems ignorant and not very entertaining. Besides, movies over the last few years are all dark - even the light-hearted ones.

This movie made me tired."
"for weeks leading up to the film movie insiders have been claiming that not only is it the best batman movie but that heath ledger deserves a Oscar nod for his work as the joker here is my short take on the film sorry its 4am and i just got home. the film overall is about as good as its every going to get as a action film and as a film on its own i really do think as of what i have seen so far it deserves at least a Oscar nom for best film the acting alround is just top shelf stuff. i will say this the film felt abit long but it needed to be. OK on to the cast, batman from watching the trailers and stuff u expect the film to be all about the joker and i was worried that batman would be pushed into the back....this is not the case. the film overall doesn't follow one person it follows the story and i think thats what makes it such a good movie cause in the end the story is the important part. OK my one knock on the film heath ledgers joker was good but i didn't think it was Oscar good, i will say he holds his own with jack's joker....actually i think its better but i don't think is Oscar good. i liked the way they used him in the film he pops in does the damage and pops out and it really works best that way. now Aaron Eckhart's two face/dent makes tommy lee's a joke....but really aaron take on both dent and twoface were amazing the characters are taken to deep levels and it really gave the film a extra kick and props to the special effects guys it looked so real. bale i think carries the story well just like in begins while i do think ledger and eckhart take some thunder away from him the movie over all turns out better for it, and its not like he doesn't have his moments ether. Gyllenhaal replaces homes and honestly i would have rather homes im not saying she did a bad job i just think with home's work on thank you for smoking she would have been a better choice if they could of had her. or wanted her? finally the supports of freeman caine and oldmen work just as well as they did in the past and special note to chin han also made good use of his screen time overall its easy to say this is by far the best of the batman movies. if i had to compare it to anything its like saying batman begins is like a star war iv and D.K is like EP:v both are good but this one just takes it that next level up"
"Truly a movie that must be seen by all..I am a Batman fan,my favorite superhero,and Cristian Bale has made me proud once again with his performance in The Dark Knight,he did well from Batman Begins and in The Dark Knight,he confirmed it..But to me,i really did enjoy and was blown away by Ledger's breathtaking performance here,i mean how can you not be blown away.?!I'm sorry to Jack Nicholson,he was still incredible in the original but Ledger,WOW..I have always been a fan of Ledger,seen pretty much all of his movies,and with this performance as The Joker,he needs to receive some kind of award,because (RIP) had he been alive,i can guarantee,he will be wanted by all movie directors/studios to be a star of their movies..So,I bow down to The Legendary Heath Ledger/ The Joker.."
Excellent film and great performance by Heath Ledger
Awesome movie and fabulous acting of joker and batman
"It's the best superhero movie to date. Amazing casting, the cast played their parts with emotion. Great framing, lighting, suspense and just everything about this movie is amazing!"
Like I said The Dark Knight was the best movie I have watched. It's my favourite movie. I mean Christian Bale was the best Batman ever. And Joker was also best. Believe me both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are best.
"Oh boy.. there's a reason why this movie is so popular. IT'S BRILLIANT!

Remarkable acting, Heath Ledger's performance as Joker felt so realistic, I totally enjoyed the chemistry between Joker and Batman in this movie.

What I didn't like was : how Harvey got his scars..it felt kinda rushed, and the shaky cam is still there, not so prominent as Batman Begins, but still.."
"Just watched the batman, and i had to go back to a movie actually worthy of praise.

Everything about the dark knight is just great. How the shots was made, the music, the tone of the movie and the underlying story/motive."
"I know it sounds a bit too cliché when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.

The story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.

Let's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.

Next let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.

Then we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.

Jim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.

And finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.

The Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out."
"A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience."
One of my ten favorite films of 2008. Great cast. Oldman deserved an Oscar nomination. The Dark Knight is perhaps the most modern comic blockbuster has given us
"This film didn't spook me when i was young, now with my adult brain, this film is super intense and psychological. The most amazing part is, it's never boring. I didnt check my phone like i usually do. This film made me jump, i forgot about the joker killing the fake batmans off...Very good film. Better than no way home. Im so glad my brain forgot about most of this film because it was like brand new to me. And I LOVED IT SO MUCH."
"The film was very disappointing. Firstly Heath Ledger, wow didn't see that coming. He was terrific. From A knights tale to the dark knight...... not the same actor surely. The tongue flicks and glaring at the camera were very real indeed. I am going to compare this to the 1989 film because in recent times that is the best comparison we can make. The 89 film was entertaining, this wasn't. It was too dark, too dreary and left me feeling a bit depressed which just isn't the aim of comics. Christian Bale's voice as Batman was ridiculous, I didn't have any empathy with his character at all, didn't feel for him.... just nothing. Thought that I wouldn't want to live in Gotham as it was so dreary and felt that Commissioner Gordon was just too earnest. Chris Nolan gave us the excellent Memento and I think another good film in Insomnia. Though I appreciate the lack of CGI (very refreshing) and the last half an hour of the film, i fidgeted throughout and by the end felt I could have left early. Last year the Bourne Ultimatum rattled along and I came out of the cinema entertained. This was just depressing. Can't understand why this is considered to be the third best film of all time on IMDb...... astounding."
Everything in this movie is perfect. Joker (Heath ledger ) nailed it. I love the cinematography. And nolans directing.
"I dont have one complaint about this movie. I could watch it every day. Has the perfect amount of action, comedic relief, suspense and drama. Will always be a 10/10 from me."
"This movie is hands down one of the greatest films ever created. Meticulously plotted, boldly directed, emotionally satisfying and grand in scale are just a few ways to describe this colossus of filmmaking. Heath Ledger easily surpasses even the hype with a masterclass, screen devouring performance. Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are also incredible.

You need to see this movie at least once in your lifetime - go see it now!!"
"After defeating the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), Batman and Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) have little time to return to normal life. The mafia is growing, and there's a new menace prowling the streets: The Joker (Heath Ledger, in his last performance). Can the Batman handle a villain who has no morals, no goals, no methods and is completely unpredictable? Also, a love triangle forms between Wayne, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).

There's little use in writing a review of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the critics loved it, fans love it, the sales are going through the roof and are likely to pass every record ever set. And I loved it, too, making it easily the film of the year and both an action-packed thriller as well as a bit of a tear-jerker. Heck, even small amounts of comic relief were thrown in (especially if you like dark humor).

I could make complaints: the spinning camera shots were overdone. The Batman voice -- digitally altered for no good reason -- was excessively gruff. The ""Bat-Sonar"" was far-fetched, cheesy and pointless. And bullet reconstruction to get a fingerprint? Doubtful. And the Wayne-Batman character was largely flat and uninteresting, encouraging fans to root for the Joker. So, there was room for perfection (which is why this film, as great as it is, cannot receive a perfect score).

Concerns aside, the film was well done, as Christopher Nolan and Bale work well together (see ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""). The action is intense, the violence superb for a PG-13 film. There's some suspense, plot twists, unexpected deaths. The romance aspect is a bit unclear (when does this film take place -- Rachel seems to have found a fiancé fairly fast). And Heath Ledger, oh my.

The hype around this fill was very Ledger-centric, declaring him as Oscar-worthy. I thought this was exaggerated due to his untimely demise and was therefore disrespectful. However, the praise was well-deserved. This was the Joker, inside and out. I couldn't even visually Ledger under the makeup. I'll always love Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but Ledger brings his ""A"" game. If he is nominated, I accept it; and if he wins, that seems reasonable to me. Best performance so far this year, in any genre.

As I said in the beginning, my review is pretty much just more or what you've already heard. The rumors are true, but judging by the sales of the picture, you've already seen it and know first-hand. If you haven't, see it in the theater while you can. Or rent it. Not sure if it's a movie worth owning (I can't see myself watching it repeatedly, depending on the special features). But this may be the superhero movie that defines the genre."
ONE OF BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!! 4K MUST HAVE!!!!
"The Best Joker ever, just legendary Amazing Extraordinary Complex Dark"
"Normally I would give this a 7.5 out of 10 but since I cant' I'll give it a seven. How anyone could rate this title that high on IMDb.com is amazing to me. It's mostly fanboys that believe this is the best movie ever and the best thing since sliced bread but what most fanboys fail to notice because they lack objectivity is that while the movie is a good one, it is quite flawed and nowhere near as perfect as many of the fanboys have rated.

A couple things I noticed when I watch this movie, the movie goes on way too long. Even my friends agreed and they are huge Batman fans. There are about 3 or 4 points in the movie where it seems like it will end but goes on for another 30 minutes. And while Heath Ledger's performance is top notch and Bale as Bruce Wayne is pulled of quite flawlessly, his Batman persona is a bit weak. The voice is annoying, and many times throughout the movie, he seemingly plays second fiddle.

I can't know Eckhart's casting as Two Face but Maggie Gyllenhall just doesn't seem to fit and just seems to be a standalone piece of eye candy.

There are many things I can harp about but I'm not here to knock the movie. There are good points, cinematography great, Joker and Two Face played excellently by their counterparts, mood was effective and story flowed quite well albeit a bit too long.

BUT this movie doesn't even belong in mention to some of the greats and shame on many movie fans that had this movie rated higher than such classics as The Godfather. Obviously the fanboys bought way too much into the hype."
"What is going on with all of these maximum ratings for a barely average film? According to IMDb, this is the best film of the decade so far. Not one sane person could argue that this is justified. Have the studios finally managed to get the masses to 'believe the hype'? I was a bit skeptical about this film, due to the hype, and especially because I wasn't impressed with Batman Begins, but I must admit, the heist in the first five minutes was excellent, and I thought my skepticism was unwarranted. But then Batman turned up and began speaking like a wrestler with throat cancer, and it continued to go down hill from there. What I didn't expect this film to be was tedious. But it was. It was far too long and bored my pants off me. There was no character development, the story was convoluted and over-complex and it was far too long. But my my main problem, and this goes against nearly every reviewer here, even those who weren't impressed, I thought Heath Ledger was absolutely awful! Who are these people calling for a posthumous Oscar? There is nothing I despise more than a 'look at me' performance. Ledger did all the tricks required to portray a 'crazy guy', including shifting his eyes up, down, left and right at every opportunity, and ingeniously, due to having his mouth cut as a child, he keeps licking around the inside of his mouth, which rather than being an impressive feat of method acting is actually as irritating as watching a fat man eat chips with his mouth open. His performance was utterly self-indulgent and it seems like all you sycophants fell for it. The only decent acting performance in this film is Eckhart. Caine and Morgan bore, and Bale, with his 'employ me for movie trailers' voice barely has one dimension. I would have rated this film higher if it hadn't taken itself so seriously, but as it stands it is a pretentious hyped-up and tedious movie. At last, the dark truth."
"I'll grant that you have to be fairly intellectual to understand this movie, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless.

Heath Ledger is incredible, probably the greatest acting performance ever from a single actor.

I feel like the intellectual part comes in when you try to understand the characters. I have read other reviews saying that the joker made no sense, but in truth, the darker you think of him, the more sense he makes.

""Plotholes"" are also very easily ""filled"" when paying attention to the film."
An excellent movie with an amazing performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker
"A perfectly made movie, with Heath Ledger at his best. Batman Begins started the trend of 'dark/serious' movies, and just when you thought a movie couldn't be better... The Dark Knight came out with an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger.

As much as you hate the Joker character in the movie, in the end you truly feel bad. Every scene he's in gets so intense with your eyes glued to the TV, it's really hard to get side tracked by thinking of something else!

Sadly The Dark Knight Rises wasn't that great, this movie still stands as one of the best movies out there."
"Whatever else it may be, ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's follow up to his ""Batman Begins,"" the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.

The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.

I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.

The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.

So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since ""Citizen Kane.""

Grade: A"
"I have enjoyed batman for a long time and despite my rabid fanaticism this movie took me to a whole new level. This is barely a superhero movie; it's utterly devoted from start to finish as an action-drama and could stand alone by all means. I admit I was skeptical of what it would be like, what with the list of villains potentially bogging down the story, the change of actress for the character Rachel Dawes and of course Heath Ledger's death which I feared might make the movie a target for his fans to run wild. However I have never been so overjoyed to be so wrong; Maggie Gylennhal is a wonderful actress as Katie Holmes' replacement; her character was good enough to avoid the melodramatic angle and was rather sublime about any of the relationships, none of the villains took away from the movie or cluttered it in the least, and Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic as the clown prince of crime; he deserves all the praise he gets for his performance which was scary and funny at the same time. Not once did it seem that the actor was tooting his own thespian horn (as I think jack Nicholson did when he played the joker) in fact I got the feeling Ledger was determined to have fun with it and I hope he did because he made a wonderful last impression with this skeptic. You don't have to be a fan to recognize what a thrill ride this movie is; my only warning to you is that you are not in for a mindless bubble-gum superhero flick that is short and simple; this is quality cinema and batman has never had so much solid footing in this area. My hats off to all who were involved. Go watch this movie now!"
"This is the first movie sense The Lord of the Rings movies that had mad, crazy, super hype and surpassed it. I thought it was getting hyped up for the wrong reasons (the tragedy). I had my doubts going into this film because everyone was talking about the Ledger. After seeing so many previews, after seeing the film and knowing what other films the actor was in, he NAILED the Joker.

I was happy that the film had more to offer than the preview had shown. It had some unexpected moments (which was good) and everyone one, and I do mean, everyone to include the bit players were wonderful in this movie. Nolan commanded and got some of the best work out of these people. Christian Bale just cemented that he is either better but no less than at the same level as Keaton's Batman and in the way, director Nolan film is better because it's more raw than Tim Burton's Batman. It doesn't seem like some faraway city. Kudos also goes to the City of Chicago for allowing Nolan to do whatever he wanted, so we have a lot less blue screen (cgi) effects and more realistic action sequences.

But the man of the hour, is Heath Ledger. Like in so many movies where the villain steals the movie, this is no exception. You can see and sense the insanity in Ledger's Joker. I mean Jack Nicholson played Jack in the first Batman, but who would have expected this demented performance out of Ledger. And it was a great performance without the over the top, maniacal campiness that actors tend to do when playing villains.

Now the only thing I wasn't crazy about was Batman's voice, it sounded a bit fake and it was hard to hear at times because it was so low. But that didn't take ANYTHING at all, away from the movie. This is a must to see on the big screen. I think its a must to see on the big screen twice and it's a must purchase on blu-ray when it's release. The movie runs about 2 hours and 45 minutes so be sure to take your bathroom break before the film start because you will not want to miss a minute.

Director/Writer Christopher Nolan has that special film makers touch. He screwed with out Heads with Memento. He dazzled us with The Presitge (another movie with Bale in it). He reinvigorated us with Batman Begins and now he stuns us with the well-crafted ""Dark Knight"". We all seen what could happen to a franchise in the hands of a lesser director (Batman Returns, Batman and Robin) and its nice to see something that takes your breath away. The Dark Knight will win lots of awards, but I think it already won the biggest, audience approval. Thumbs up for the Dark Knight."
"I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle, Australia(15/7/08), let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008.

Every performance in this movie is just fantastic, and Heath Ledger Owns The JOKER, I don't think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is in.

This has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed, this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original.

Make 2008 the year to see and enjoy one of the years best.

And i hope in Feb 09, Heath is nominated for an Oscar, he will always be remembered Cheers"
"To all the moronic parents who brought their children to this film and complain about it 'not being for kids' and that your 'kids will have nightmares for weeks', here's a clue - it's PG13; and if the voluminous (that means lots of) marketing (this means the advertisements you see on TV and in your People Magazine) isn't enough to give you an idea that this isn't a family superhero movie with a funny clown, then you have nobody to blame than your own dumb self.

The sooner you wake up and pay attention to what you're feeding your children, the sooner the rest of the world can move on without hearing you blame others for your own ineffective (this means dumb) parenting."
"Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed.

What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.

Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential.

Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work.

The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.

The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody.

For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes."
"Great and worth to watch, The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made."
I love batman he's basically the father I never had.
"Whenever i watch this film, it takes me to another level of creativity. Movie makes me more powerful than ever."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a towering achievement in the realm of superhero cinema, transcending genre conventions to deliver a gripping and thought-provoking exploration of heroism, morality, and the nature of chaos. With its complex characters, thrilling action sequences, and profound themes, this film captivates audiences from beginning to end, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern cinema.

At the heart of ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker, one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. Ledger's portrayal is nothing short of legendary, capturing the anarchic spirit of the character with a chilling intensity and magnetic charisma. His Joker is a force of nature, a chaotic agent who seeks to upend the established order and expose the hypocrisy and corruption that lurk beneath the surface of society.

Opposite Ledger's Joker stands Christian Bale's Batman, a brooding and conflicted figure grappling with his own inner demons and the moral complexities of his crusade against crime. Bale brings a quiet intensity to the role, imbuing Batman with a sense of gravitas and depth that grounds the film amidst its larger-than-life spectacle.

But ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a battle between hero and villain; it's a nuanced exploration of the blurred lines between good and evil, order and chaos. Nolan deftly weaves together multiple narrative threads, from the escalating conflict between Batman and the Joker to the ethical dilemmas faced by Gotham's law enforcement and political elite. The result is a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally thrilling, challenging audiences to grapple with the complexities of morality and justice in a world plagued by corruption and violence.

Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" is also a technical marvel, with breathtaking action sequences, stunning visual effects, and a haunting score by Hans Zimmer that heightens the film's sense of tension and unease. Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the towering skyscrapers of Gotham City to the shadowy alleyways where the Dark Knight prowls.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its genre to become a timeless work of art. Whether you're a fan of comic books or not, this is a film that demands to be seen and appreciated for its bold storytelling, impeccable craftsmanship, and profound thematic depth."
"It's a very soft 9, but it's a 9/10 for me.

Directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer - these guys are in their primes here. Not that the same isn't true of some of the actors involved in this film, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart.

It's hard for me to do a review on this film and certainly the character of the late Heath Ledger is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. He is played to perfection. Perfect would even be putting it mildly. Ledger is so great in this film that all the awards and recognition he has received from around the world are too little.

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Gary Oldman are all super, but the one who shines brightest out of the entire cast with the exception of Ledger is Aaron Eckhart and his character, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Christopher Nolan's hidden ace. A perfect addition to the film's story.

The action scenes are OK, the sound is good, the film is generally very good technically and is far from the most successful in the genre, but the acting, the pacing and the story itself make The Dark Knight (2008) the giant that it is.

I recommend it along with the other two installments in the series, ""Batman Begins"" (2005), and the not-so-good ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012).

Final score: 9/10."
"I am not a huge Batman fan. But I finally watched this like 8 years later ... I was hoping for Darker, but for a Batman movie it was action packed. It was like Point Break in Gotham but was entertaining. Ledger was good but not the hype performance everyone freaked about. Good Joker, but he didn't scare me. I want joker to creep me TF out and fear his wrath. OH well. Good movie, totally worth watching. I think Bale is a good Batman but I really like Keaton. I wonder what a new Tim Burton remake would look like with all of the CGI available now that was not around when he made the first Batman with Keaton. I say we petition that. Get Burton on another, really dark one. But please, please, please. No Ben Afleck!

Happy Watching!"
"OK, lets get it out of the way, I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?"
This tital was my good tital wish if i would be like the confidently directed with a complex story.
I've lost count of how many times i have watched this. Returned to it after watching Joker. Different interpretation but Ledger's Joker is perfection
Joker was absolutely amazing! Simply a must see film for anyone who wishes to see the best joker performance.
"Absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen. The Joker and Batman fantastically portrayed by Heath and Christian with phenomenal chemistry between the characters. Over a decade on since it was released and countless superhero watched by myself since and this is still definitely the best one out there. The depth and rationalities the joker gives leave the viewer wondering whether he is crazy or completely sane in this thought provoking cinematic masterpiece.

No spoilers here but when you watch it you will be on the edge of your seat with anticipation, you will also feel so connected to both the joker and batman on an emotional level."
"I've been waiting for this film since I had seen Batman Begins in the cinema three/four years ago, but I was disappointed that I did not see anything new. It also didn't help that the plot in the film was muddled up. There were different subplots happening in between the film and by the last half I was totally lost; even my boyfriend has fallen asleep. I didn't like Maggie Gyllenhal's role as Rachael - she was bland as a blank of wood/black tea with no sugar, *really* boring as an actress!

As usual, Bale puts on a great performance and I have always enjoyed the films he has been in from the past (Machinist, The Prestige, Equiliberium, Batman Begins, American Psycho). However, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne, I felt I hadn't seen anything fresh from his performance or, if there was, this was overshadowed by the film (I am sure he will make up for this in Terminator 4). I like Christopher Nolan as well as a director, but I think this film was all about money and not about quality film-making. Compare this film to Memento and The Prestige - the Dark Knight is nowhere near as good as those films. In other words, from the 'success' this film has made, it would look as though Nolan has sold out which is a real shame.

I have idea no where thes hype about this film has come from, but I suspect it is because of the fact that people have been defining this film as one of Heath Ledger's ""finest performance"". Sure, his role as the Joker worked well on screen, but, even so, it is not worthy of winning a BAFTA/Oscar for his performance. People have generously given this film either a 9/10 simply because they have bought the fascination surrounding Ledger's performance/death along with the excessive violence and not judging on this film, realistically.

This film is worth no more than a 6, I am afraid - it should NOT be in IMDb's top 10. Having said that, this is nothing more than 'popcorn' film."
I love it. There was so much here and I particularly loved this take on the Joker.
GREAT MOVIE. MUST SEEN. HEATH LEADGER IS INCREDIBLE CLEARLY THE BEST JOKER RIP
"Forever immortal icon Above classification level, it has a very good cast with talented acting and a talented director The movie you will never get poring of watching it.

I wish for everyone a pleasant watching."
"""The Dark Knight"" goes far beyond the label of a blockbuster or action film. Christopher Nolan crafts a powerful cinematic experience, confronting audiences with ethical and psychological dilemmas that stretch beyond the genre's conventions. Right from the start, the film challenges us to follow Batman in a struggle that goes beyond physical fights, diving deep into the dark territory of moral choices. More than a simple hero-villain face-off, Nolan shows just how much Bruce Wayne is driven-not by glory-but by a compulsive need to do what's right in a world where ""right"" is increasingly ambiguous. At its core, the film explores complex themes like sacrifice, surveillance, and the price of morality, redefining what to expect from a superhero adaptation.

The backbone of ""The Dark Knight"" is the dynamic between Batman and the Joker, portrayed iconically by Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is utterly disturbing, driven by a logic-defying impulse to expose humanity's fragility. This Joker embodies chaos in its purest form, revealing and manipulating Gotham's and Batman's vulnerabilities. More than an antagonist, he's a chaotic force that pushes Batman to question his own values, forcing him to confront the moral shadows of his own actions. The Joker imposes impossible dilemmas on Gotham and Batman alike, serving as a twisted mirror for Bruce Wayne's limitations and the clash between justice and obsession.

Christian Bale gives a gritty performance, turning Bruce Wayne into one of cinema's most complex characters. Instead of a perfect hero, his Batman is a man exhausted, torn between his commitment to protect Gotham and the personal toll of that mission. Bale brings a physicality to the role, using a raspy, intense voice under the cowl to express Batman's psychological weight. He masterfully balances the carefree playboy persona with the brooding vigilante, underscoring that Bruce is as masked in public as he is in the cape. In his interactions with the Joker, Bale conveys a complex mix of anger, frustration, and vulnerability, making him a powerful hero who struggles and wears down like anyone in Gotham. Bale's raw authenticity makes his Batman unforgettable, pushing beyond the superhero archetype into a movingly human portrayal.

The urban setting of Gotham becomes another main character, with a darkly realistic design heightened by cinematography that avoids over-the-top visuals while retaining the city's oppressive identity. Gotham is a battlefield where fear and corruption touch every scene, reflecting the complex morality of its residents. Each shot is carefully crafted to create a space where Batman is a dark vigilante and paradoxically vulnerable, as if the very place constantly reminds him of the impossibility of eradicating evil completely. Nolan makes Gotham a believable city where heroism meets real-world barriers, adding to the thick, intense atmosphere throughout the film.

Bruce Wayne's moral journey is heightened when he sees hope in Harvey Dent, believing him capable of carrying the weight of justice without turning to darkness. Aaron Eckhart plays Dent with idealistic energy that slowly breaks under pressure and tragedy, showing the fall of a ""White Knight"" into a haunting Two-Face. The story carefully parallels Dent's downfall with Batman's sacrifices, suggesting that even the purest heroes can be corrupted by pain and loss. This duality between Bruce and Dent deepens the story, and instead of simplifying the hero-villain theme, it builds complex characters who shift between light and shadow, highlighting the real cost of justice.

Nolan boldly takes on contemporary ethical questions, like surveillance and power boundaries, exploring just how far security can justify the loss of privacy. Batman's use of mass surveillance technology to catch the Joker raises the ends-versus-means debate. This decision creates one of the movie's most crucial conflicts, with Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) acting as a moral compass, challenging Batman's methods. The clash between safety and ethics lends the film a relevance that resonates beyond fiction, sparking reflections on society and the role of power in protection or oppression. Nolan's choice to include this conversation elevates ""The Dark Knight"" from action flick to critical commentary, raising questions that stick with viewers.

Technically, the film is flawless, with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score enriching the atmosphere with tension and emotional depth. The sound design is especially effective in Joker scenes, marked by a sharp, ominous sound that builds sinister anticipation before he even speaks. The action scenes, executed with realism and precision, are dynamic and visually impactful without overshadowing the plot or characters, always advancing the story. Nolan strategically uses every technical element to heighten the narrative, immersing viewers in Bruce Wayne's moral struggle-a vigilante constantly torn between his principles and actions.

In the end, ""The Dark Knight"" transcends the superhero genre by diving into themes of morality, sacrifice, and humanity's darker side. Nolan drives a narrative that challenges audiences to see beyond the battle of good versus evil, questioning the cost of being a hero in a world where justice and ethics often clash. Batman's final image, bearing Gotham's sins and fading into the shadows, is one of cinema's most iconic and melancholy shots, capturing the weight of his burden and the complexity of his role. Ultimately, the film stands as a masterpiece that redefines genre expectations, leaving a lasting mark on both superhero films and the cinematic landscape."
"He really makes this movie. His joker is iconic truly a bar to reach for, for all other actors."
Heathe Leadger the best interpretation in the world
"In The Dark Night Movie, Joker in this movie is really a legend, He is my favorite Character in this movie, more then the Hero. The Hero is the Batmen but most famous character is the joker, the way he presents his character is mind blowing, i always gonna miss his acting, i wish he is alive so i can see him in more movies and more shades of characters. Batmen is a Super hero but Joker is a Super Villain of all time. Nolan is a great filmmaker who knows the core of emotions and character design, his script and dialogues are amazing, he is one of the best filmmaker of this century. Many filmmakers learn filmmaking from his style."
"when I gave my opinion with 9 marks ,I was not give it for the movie or for Christian Bale or for director but only for Heath Ledger who made A wonderful performance,he was able to delve deeper into this character ,really with loud voice and A great honor I want to say BRAVOOOOOOO!!! But in general the story was amazing especially in last minutes,and as always Morgan Freeman Was scintillating ,and Maggie Gyllenhaal also. finally I believe that without Heath Ledger and his performance this movie was not take more than 6 because he was the secret of success. thanks Heath Ledger and we will not forget you and your fantastic performance..."
"Remember when the joker explains why he uses a knife instead of a gun? He prefers to savour the little details, read between the lines, appreciate the moment. As opposed to a violent, quick thrill of a gun. For me this film ended up being more like a machine gun than a knife.

Let's start with the excellent aspects of this film. Strong performances - Bale is fantastic, Michael Caine and Morgan freeman always produce excellent performances and this again does not disappoint, Heath ledger is impeccable. Music score is incredible by Hans Zimmer. Cannot imagine a better soundtrack is possible for this film. Epic use of image, immersing cinematography, the make up and costume department need a raise.

What's a mixed bag and what's poor . The plot - the plot is decent, but far from outstanding. It's about half an hour too long. There's certainly one chapter too many. In the last 45 mins we have hospital gate and ferry gate. You really need to choose only one there. The ferry scene paints to us what the joker is trying to prove - that when it comes down to it everyone will become selfish, save themselves before others no matter the cost. However I don't think they quite hit the nail on the head with it. The way it pans out, for me, is too unrealistic. Call it my lack of faith in human nature. I feel a more believable scenario of human heroism would've sent a stronger message. Hospital gate provides very little to the plot, except 20 mins of watching a headache. Philosophical themes and execution - Heath Ledger's acting is incredible so don't come at me, but the joker is too one dimensional. I get it, he likes chaos, but I want more depth. It may be good enough for the comics but not for a film to the caliber of this one. There's just a little too much spoon feeding dialogue. All this talk about chaos and human nature. Allow the audience to read between the lines, decifer the deeper meanings for themselves. Be a knife, not a gun. Pacing - I can't really fault the pacing until it comes to Harvey's transformation into two face. This part of the film is really poor. Even when I watched this film as a kid I was like come on. It's not even a character arc , he more or less wakes up a sadistic maniac, like Peter Parker just wakes up as spider man. Im not saying two face is a bad character, but a substantially more amount of time is necessary for us as the audience to realistically believe this transformation from hero to villain. And lastly, the film is just a bit too crash bang wallop. Just turn the volume down a little bit.

Now, I admit this review focuses more on the bad than the good. I can only say that's because everyone rates this film so highly that I think the weaknesses are more relevant. It's a great film and I understand the hype. But we have to admit there are major flaws to this film. I hate the way people really brand the word about 'overrated' , I don't like using it - it makes you sound as a sort of Scrooge. However , with an IMDB rating of 9/10 I think there might be a strong case for it right here."
"The trick to these comic book superhero movies is not to take the source material too seriously. That's what made the original Batman from the 1980's, with Jack Nickolson as the Joker, work so well; everything about that movie, including all the main characters, was over the top, and rightfully so. We are, after all, talking about a man who goes out and fights crime while dressed up as a bat. How seriously, really, are we supposed to take such a notion? But this movie (among its various other flaws) takes itself WAY too seriously. It's supposed to be some deep, even epic, tale of, well, something. But, hey, if I want that, I could read Homer. Or Shakespeare. Or watch ""The Godfather"". Stories that truly are epic, in no small part because they feature real human characters, not ones that came out of a cartoon book.

That said, I can only review so much of this movie because, quite honestly, I don't remember all that much from it. Nothing about it truly stood out in my mind, other than that the general theme seemed to be to inflict upon the audience several scenes of considerable cruelty and sadism. And, unlike in other movies where these qualities played a significant role (Silence of the Lambs, Apocalypse Now), here these elements seem to exist solely for shock value, not because they actually add anything to our deeper understanding of the story.

Which brings us to the character of the Joker. Let me be blunt - Nickolson's Joker was at least ten times better than this one. Both are completely unbelievable, but Jack's Joker was at least interesting, even fun. He was a pleasure to watch in much the same way that a good James Bond villain is. But there is nothing pleasurable at all about Heath Ledger's Joker. First off, he is so psychotic that he couldn't function anywhere outside of an insane asylum; he kills off his own henchmen, burns their stolen money before their very eyes, yet this psycho somehow enlists a small army of loyal followers without giving them any reason to be loyal at all, and yet, despite being a complete walking mental meltdown, he manages to put in motion any number of very detailed terrorist plots that would require the exact opposite mindset, namely, one of cold and calculating rationality. In short, as a movie villain, he simply fails. Not only is he not credible at all, his sole contribution to the story is to add the aforementioned cruelty and sadism, making this not only a stupid and unbelievable movie, but a thoroughly depressing one as well. I mean, seriously. If you want to see movie characters who have a dark, twisted, and sadistic streak and yet come off as credible on the screen, one need look no further than such persons as Tommy from ""Goodfellas"" or Luca Brasi from ""The Godfather"". But the Joker from this film is just a void. Encountering his character was like stepping on a dog turd. The experience is wholly unpleasant and disgusting, but thankfully you forget about it pretty soon.

"If you're interested in acting, filmmaking or movies... this is one of the greatest examples of all of that. Whole Nolan's trilogy is masterpiece. But this second movie is probably the greatest one of them."
"All you need to do is switch this film on for 30 seconds, and your hooked. Simple"
"The movie showed how a real villain can cause this much chaos to the city. And how he really pushed Batman to his edge, yet not all of them are strong like Batam as some crossed the line. The best movie that shows the two iconic figures Batman and Joker rival together."
Heath Ledger will forever be the best joker ever!!! and christian bale was a decent batman in my opinion.
"Iconic! ""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that redefines the superhero genre. Released in 2008, this film stands as a testament to the transformative power of storytelling and the impact of exceptional performances. At its core, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. Ledger's posthumous Academy Award-winning performance elevates the character beyond a mere antagonist, making the Joker a symbol of chaotic brilliance and anarchy.

Christian Bale, reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, brings a brooding intensity that complements the film's exploration of duality and morality. Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a gritty and realistic Gotham City that becomes a character in itself. The cinematography, coupled with Hans Zimmer's haunting score, adds layers of tension and depth to the narrative.

""The Dark Knight"" transcends the typical superhero narrative, evolving into a crime thriller that delves into the complexities of heroism. The film's social commentary on the thin line between order and chaos resonates throughout, challenging audiences intellectually and emotionally. As the capstone of Nolan's Batman trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"" sets a high standard with its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and cinematic brilliance.

This film isn't just a comic book adaptation; it's a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Its impact on the superhero genre is undeniable, and its legacy continues to influence filmmakers, setting a standard that few have matched. ""The Dark Knight"" remains a beacon of excellence, reminding us that a superhero film can be both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of modern filmmaking."
"This movie is very blockbuster of Christopher nolan and i like this movie so much. And, this movie, everybody like this because, christian bale nailed it in this movie and its better than robert pattison's movie named 'batman'. Some scenes in this movie is mind-blowing and crazy, i really like this movie. The villain in this character is very fantastic and awesome role-play of villain. And im giving this movie as 10/10. Christopher nolan choose the right character of hero and im surprised and everyone in youtube got viral and lots of moments and everybody should watch this movie, its very amazing."
Hands Down this is the greatest Superhero movie of all time Better than any marvel movie The best Batman Best Joker Best Harvey Dent/Two Face Heath Ledgers performance as the joker was just epic.
"Oddly enough, I don't go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it'll be over-hyped and bloated; that's just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.

As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger's unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn't just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare's finest plays.

Let's first get to what I didn't like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie's predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I've always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who's consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he's got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn't tell people everything, and that's nice. Endearing, even. But Bale's inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there's more than meets the eye. Bale's Batman doesn't feel like he's consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.

Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she's smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don't see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they'll get it right.

And then there's the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it's like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can't quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who's better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent's a noble crusader, the district attorney who's going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who's there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you'd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn't seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.

The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It's not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there's a way to do this without producing a film that's two and a half hours long. If you're going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.

But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce's conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it's supposed to be gloomy ol' Gotham.

So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It's not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don't even get clever plotting that we might expect from what's purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There's much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that's forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger."
"i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10."
"""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic masterpiece that redefines the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's direction masterfully weaves a gripping narrative filled with moral complexity and intense action. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary; he embodies chaos with chilling charisma and depth, creating an iconic villain that lingers long after the credits roll. The film's exploration of duality, justice, and sacrifice resonates deeply, making it a profound experience. With stunning visuals, a haunting score, and unforgettable performances, ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a flawless triumph in filmmaking that elevates both its characters and its themes to unforgettable heights."
"This is one of those movies that you must watch it with one sit from the beginning to the end without making you lose any interest in it. I also watched the continuation of this movie it wasn't bad at all, there are few movies which i like to watch with one sit and they are really few i personally don't really like superhero movies that much but this one really got my attention i mean it has Christian Bale (Batman) in it of course it was going to be a really enjoying movie i recommend to anyone who have not watched the movie to see it really is an impressive one really sad that we can not have a joker like this one anymore i mean Heath Ledger (Joker) really hit that high joker performance he was and still is for me the best joker in a batman movie."
"The only superhero movie that can call itself a masterpiece. A film about good and evil, anarchy and authoritarianism, supposed order and chaos. Two sides of the same coin, two weights of a scale, if one of them is missing, the other cannot exist."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends intense action, profound storytelling, and unforgettable performances. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of mesmerizing, elevating the film to unparalleled heights. Nolan's direction, coupled with Hans Zimmer's iconic score, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that captivates audiences from start to finish. The film's exploration of morality and the complexities of heroism cements its status as a modern masterpiece in the superhero genre.

Nolan's visionary storytelling and Bale's compelling Batman make ""The Dark Knight"" a timeless masterpiece."
", yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
"Heath ledgers character, the joker is phenomenal. One of the best acting performances ever. The dark night is a great movie, but not the best. Not in the top 25. It's Avery good movie with a thrilling story but it is a bit overrated. This movie never really gets old. And the story of heath ledger and the joker role pushing his mental state further. Heath ledger unfortunately killed himself after the role. Don't get me wrong, the dark knight is a great, excellent movie but it shouldn't be the top 3 of the world, even nearly the top 10. But the dark knight is the best sequel for a Christopher Nolan movie ever. Thank you Christopher Nolan for making the greatest superhero movie of all time."
"This is a movie which deserves more than review. O ly two word enough to explain : Almost Perfect

The job is perfect you can see the sweet of cristopher nolan in the every part of movie. There is a huge work behind this masterpiece. It has a well originated story and it has been empowered with the top class acting.

Best batman casting so far.

It is the best till the nolan decide to direct better batman movie."
Great superhero movie.I think this is the best Batman movie that has been created so far. The leading actor who plays the Joker is believe-able and draws you into the movie. The storyline was well put together and award worthy.
"After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldn't wait to see this movie.

Man was i disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.

Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i don't like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.

But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.

Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didn't like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i don't like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.

There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didn't see coming but loved it.

All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, that's crazy.

It's unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind don't rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.

Happy to share my feel about this movie,

Realkane"
"This movie is like a rollercoaster, the acting of Heath Ledger elevates the movie but Bale doesn't dissapoint no one is bad, the action is sooo gooooddd you can't even blink in this movie, the duo of Batman & Joker is so well crafted, it's an antagonist-protagonist relation that develops both, especially the protagonist. The ending is absolutely peak it gives you that sour felling but also hopeful, just absolutely peak but you should watch Batman Begins first it's possible to enjoy The Dark Knight without watching it but with Begins it's even better.

Conclusion: Watch it its peak absolutely peak."
"Christian bale was great acting as Batman . However , Heath ledger performance as joker is a masterpiece no one will ever top him deserved.

Rip Heath ledger greatest performance in film history."
"Although the Batman is not longer young, he can change the world to become better. I am looking forward to the next one, next fantastic one."
"The only negative I could give this movie is that the protagonist overshadows the main role of hero. After all, it is a batman movie. But lets face it, of all the good actors in the movie, Heath Ledger blows everyone away with his role of the joker. Not just for this movie, but this may be one of the best acting roles in history. The performance of his life. ( no pun intended ). Its a shame he died, there were more great performances in him, sadly we will never see. It would be a reasonable supposition to believe that ledger's performance may have been so extreme and brilliant due to psychological issues he was experiencing at the time which ultimately took his life. A candle burning too bright and will be missed."
"Christopher Nolan, Heath Ledger outstanding combo -plus christian Bale is amazing but the villain stole the light, and took a standing ovation by the world. Joker is the real trump card of this movie and the best until now."
"Oh, what a film! 🦇🌑 This movie is a towering achievement in the superhero genre, pushing the boundaries of storytelling and redefining what a comic book adaptation can be. Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a dark and gritty atmosphere that perfectly complements the complex themes explored in the film. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is truly mesmerizing and unforgettable, earning him a posthumous Academy Award. The film's thought-provoking exploration of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism makes it a standout in the genre. It's a must-watch for any fan of superhero movies or thrilling, thought-provoking cinema. Don't miss out on this epic Batman adventure! 🦇🌟"
"Feel that this movie is simply beautiful, I don't mind the fact that it is long, about 2 and a half hours?, but what if it is the perfect movie from experience, I went to see it at the cinema, and since then I have seen few Sometimes so as not to get bored with her, but I remember her as a damn exam man, and as Gordon says at the end, he's a hero, but that we don't need now, ...... the Dark Knight, ufff and that soundtrack , papa buenisimooooo, and finally, ... HE IS BATMAN."
"Title: ""A Cinematic Triumph: 'The Dark Knight' Reimagines Batman Like Never Before""

Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Released in 2008, this film marked a pivotal moment in the superhero genre, forever changing the way audiences perceive not only Batman but also the entire genre itself. With a mesmerizing blend of storytelling, unforgettable performances, and groundbreaking visuals, ""The Dark Knight"" remains an iconic achievement.

At its core, ""The Dark Knight"" is a crime drama wrapped in the guise of a superhero movie. Unlike its predecessors, this installment presents Batman as a complex vigilante facing moral dilemmas rather than a mere caped crusader fighting crime. Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delivers a mesmerizing performance. His portrayal is a perfect blend of brooding intensity and vulnerability, allowing the audience to empathize with the inner turmoil of the character.

However, the true standout performance in ""The Dark Knight"" is Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's take on the iconic Batman villain is nothing short of extraordinary. His Joker is an agent of chaos, a sadistic and unpredictable force who challenges Batman both physically and philosophically. Ledger's commitment to the role is palpable, and he disappears into the character, leaving the audience in awe of his magnetic and chilling performance. It's no exaggeration to say that Ledger's Joker is one of the most iconic and memorable villains in cinematic history.

The supporting cast also shines in their respective roles. Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon is the moral compass of Gotham City, and Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is a charismatic district attorney whose transformation into Two-Face is both tragic and compelling. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine bring depth and wisdom to their characters, providing the emotional grounding needed amidst the chaos.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. He creates a dark and gritty Gotham City that feels both hauntingly realistic and heightened in its cinematic grandeur. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and shot, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding intensity of Batman's world. Nolan's use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds a tangible weight to the film's action, making every punch and explosion feel real.

One of the most remarkable aspects of ""The Dark Knight"" is its exploration of complex moral themes. The film delves into questions of justice, morality, and the nature of heroism. Batman's ethical code is put to the test as he faces the Joker's nihilistic philosophy. The film challenges the audience to consider the cost of heroism and the blurred line between hero and villain.

In addition to its thematic depth, ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterclass in storytelling. The script, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is a taut and intelligent narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene building upon the last, leading to a breathtaking climax that will leave you breathless.

Hans Zimmer's score is another element that elevates ""The Dark Knight"" to a cinematic tour de force. The hauntingly beautiful music underscores the emotional beats of the film, heightening the tension and drama. Zimmer's use of recurring motifs, such as the Joker's theme, adds a layer of psychological depth to the characters.

It's worth noting that ""The Dark Knight"" is not a typical superhero film. It transcends the genre by delivering a mature and thought-provoking narrative that appeals to a broad audience. While it contains thrilling action sequences and epic battles, it also explores the human side of its characters, making it a character-driven drama that just happens to involve superheroes.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that redefined the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, Heath Ledger's unforgettable performance as the Joker, and the film's exploration of complex moral themes all contribute to its status as a modern classic. It's a film that continues to resonate with audiences and stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in cinema. Whether you're a fan of Batman or simply a lover of great filmmaking, ""The Dark Knight"" is a must-see that will leave you pondering its themes long after the credits roll."
"Spectacular and entertaining but no more than that.

Batman Begins is way better. This movie has nothing to add that movie and/or original story.

Be honest! What do you remember about this movie, a week after seeing it? Just the Joker walking out the exploding hospital I guess.

Nicely done but not ""Nolan proof"". Please don't make a third one Christopher (you're still one of my favorite directors).

Summary: go see it for it's spectacular actions and... that's it.

Nothing more! (sorry)

This is the required 10th line"
"Amazing movie by Nolan, could not make a more real version of Bats and Joker"
"For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect.

excellent movie ever! the ""joker"" character was outstanding! the heath ledger gives excellent performance in this movie,and the best music work by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard,this is a blockbuster movie of 2008.GENIUS AT WORK by Christopher Nolan.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a MASTERPIECE 10 of 10 stars."
This Movie for sure made me see batman in a different light after all he is a human and has no super powers but it just shows that you don't need super powers to be a super hero. I really liked the action in this particular film compared to the other batman films Christan Bale did a great job as batman and is possibly my preferred batman overall in the batman series. Pretty soon the new batman vs Superman will be coming out although I myself am not really a D.C fan I am definitely going to be seeing that after I watch Marvels Captain America World At War maybe after seeing Batman V.S Superman I may convert into a D.C fan and after seeing pictures of the movie that is a very likely chance
"""The Dark Knight"" (2008) is a monumental achievement in superhero cinema, transcending the genre to tell a gripping, morally complex story that goes far beyond the origins of the comic book. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is not just a sequel to ""Batman Begins"", but a cinematic masterpiece in its own right.

Nolan's direction is masterful, interweaving intricate storylines with breathtaking action sequences and moments of profound introspection. The film's visual palette is dark and gritty and perfectly captures the menacing atmosphere of Gotham City.

""The Dark Knight"" is not just a superhero film, but a cinematic epic that transcends the boundaries of its genre. With its unforgettable cast, gripping story and thematic depth, it remains a timeless classic that has captivated audiences worldwide."
""" You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain""

Opening with a cunning master-show; a blisteringly devious bank heist that gives us the most iconic villain ever to grace the screen. A creepy Glasgow smile that keeps us up at night, spooking, haunting and endlessly projecting in our psyches for years and years, echoing from generation through generation. Everything holds up so well, in fact too well. The Dark Knight is a monolithic milestone of vigilante epicness, a hard-boiled crime noir masquerading as a PG-13 superhero movie, and a heroic ode for the ages.

Clap, Clap, Clap (in Joker's manner) for Nolan's ballistic nihilism, no holds barred mannerism and his spectacular vision has bequeathed us with multiple moral time-bombs, finely-tuned characterizations and dynamically explosive set-pieces: fake Batmans sequence, Harvey vs Rachel, 18-wheeler truck spinning and flipping upside down and Joker's brazenly blasting at the Batpod and so on. The villains have largely overpowered our hero in this one as darkness triumphantly cloaks up daylight, subverting the very foundation of comic-book genre, showing something we haven't seen before.

Similar to that magic pencil, The Dark Knight is relentless with its freakishly brutal power, casting an Abracadabra that's capable of knocking you out, mind-blown and ice cold on the floor. Dark and somber but equally rich in aesthetics, rainy Gotham City is as beautiful as it is immersive. So bleak there's almost no hope left and tensions are boisterously fueled by atmospheric dangers looming near, mercilessly raising the stakes up to 10000 degrees Celsius blazing fire. With many maze-like twists possessing such unpredictable nature similar to its crazy antagonist(s), this showdown is twistedly deranged, exciting and tragic in equal measures.

A film, so monumental, its impact cannot be understated. A film as bold and as ever-lasting as the immortal name it so tragically tells the story of.

An untouchable piece of fiction that brings great life to decades of graphic novel story-telling in unfathomably ground-breaking fashion. This is the power of undisputed directing champ Christopher Nolan.

He's Not Our Hero.

He's A Silent Guardian.

A Watchful Protector.

A Dark Knight."
Greatest superheroes film. Forever film for all time.

"I really enjoyed this movie. Plot, cast, production... everything is on point. If you haven't seen The Dark Knight, you should. Some say its overrated.. no its not! It deserves its rating and its rank in the top rated IMDB movies of all time."
"The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.

Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.

On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.

And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledger's Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers' Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.

To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it should've borrowed)."
"That's really oOosm 🔥 the acting of joker is op level. His performance made us fall in love & changed people's thought about villian. Unfortunately, he passed away before releasing of the film... It's too sad because we could have watched him making another great movies and also gathering fame, popularity .. .. .. .. .. . . . ."
"I watched alot of other batman movies, especially the newest batman.

I still have to say that no one can beat the class of christian Bale.

I love it so much and i have watched it again and again."
"There is a reason i gave this movie a 10 out of 10! There is nothing to improve upon, such a classic and a fun time to watch it even more than once!"
"This was a near-perfect masterpiece, it's what Marvel wishes it could do. The movie had tons of action scenes and a great storyline, it had the best Joker of all time. Ledger's approach to Joker wasn't the corny 1900s Joker, where he was making corny cartoon jokes. Ledger's joker was a psychological joker, that messed with people's minds and had them looking in every which direction. Bale was phenomenal, he was an incredible Bruce Wayne, was disappointed that the original Rachel dropped the movie though. It was an amazing experience to watch this movie. 10/10 would recommend anyone to watch this movie, if they would like to be entertained for 2.5 hours, it's worth it.

RIP: Health Ledger, you were gone too soon."
"The world of superheroes has always been captivated by larger-than-life characters, but none have left as indelible a mark on pop culture as the iconic Dark Knight. Batman, a character beloved for his complex persona and thrilling adventures, has been brought to life in various mediums, but with the latest film, it's clear that the Caped Crusader has found a new home on the big screen. The 2023 Batman film, directed by visionary filmmaker David Fincher, is a visual masterpiece that brings this iconic character to life in ways that have never been seen before.

For someone like me, whose introduction to Batman came through animated series and comics, this film was a thrilling revelation. I was initially drawn to the character through the brilliant Batman: The Animated Series and various comic books. However, seeing Batman in a live-action setting, enhanced by state-of-the-art visual effects (VFX), was a game-changer. The film takes the character's appeal and magnifies it, creating a cinematic experience that is as thrilling as it is visually stunning.

The supporting cast is equally impressive. Selina Kyle, portrayed by a charismatic actress, embodies the complex and enigmatic Catwoman. Her chemistry with Batman is palpable, and their dynamic adds depth to the story. The film also introduces a formidable antagonist in the form of the Riddler, played by an actor who brings a chilling and intellectual malevolence to the character. The way the Riddler's elaborate puzzles and clues are woven into the narrative keeps the audience engaged in a thrilling and suspenseful mystery. Whether you're a long-time Batman aficionado or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, this film is a must-see. Batman's legend has never shone brighter on the silver screen."
This movie is one of the greatest films of all time.It show so much symbolic messages and examples of morality that represents America in 2008.
"""Batman"" isn't a comic book anymore. Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That's because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This film, and to a lesser degree ""Iron Man,"" redefine the possibilities of the ""comic-book movie.""

""The Dark Knight"" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a villain. He's a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.

The key performance in the movie is by the late Heath Ledger, as the Joker. Will he become the first posthumous Oscar winner since Peter Finch? His Joker draws power from the actual inspiration of the character in the silent classic ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928). His clown's makeup more sloppy than before, his cackle betraying deep wounds, he seeks revenge, he claims, for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film, he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film, he devises ingenious situations that force Batman (Christian Bale), Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened.

Because these actors and others are so powerful, and because the movie does not allow its spectacular special effects to upstage the humans, we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eckhart does an especially good job as Harvey Dent, whose character is transformed by a horrible fate into a bitter monster. It is customary in a comic book movie to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. ""The Dark Knight"" slips around those defenses and engages us.

Yes, the special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot on location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City, the Wrigley Building or the skyline. Chicagoans will recognize many places, notably La Salle Street and Lower Wacker Drive, but director Nolan is not making a travelogue. He presents the city as a wilderness of skyscrapers, and a key sequence is set in the still-uncompleted Trump Tower. Through these heights, the Batman moves at the end of strong wires, or sometimes actually flies, using his cape as a parasail.

The plot involves nothing more or less than the Joker's attempts to humiliate the forces for good and expose Batman' secret identity, showing him to be a poser and a fraud. He includes Gordon and Dent on his target list, and contrives cruel tricks to play with the fact that Bruce Wayne once loved, and Harvey Dent now loves, Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). The tricks are more cruel than he realizes, because the Joker doesn't know Batman's identity. Heath Ledger has a good deal of dialogue in the movie, and a lot of it isn't the usual jabs and jests we're familiar with: It's psychologically more complex, outlining the dilemmas he has constructed, and explaining his reasons for them. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who first worked together on ""Memento"") has more depth and poetry than we might have expected."
This film is a definitive 10/10 no doubts about it.
"Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: ""you're not The Devil, you're practise"" he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.

That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.

In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's ""white knight"", suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's ""dark"" but is just different in technique and characteristics.

Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.

Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down."
"In the realm of superhero movies, there exists a pinnacle of excellence that stands head and shoulders above the rest: Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Released in 2008, this film not only redefined the genre but also transcended it, delivering a gripping narrative, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes that continue to resonate with audiences worldwide. As an ardent fan of The Dark Knight, I am thrilled to share my enthusiastic review of this cinematic masterpiece.

From the moment the opening scene unfolds, The Dark Knight captivates viewers with its atmospheric cinematography and haunting score. Nolan's Gotham City is a gritty and realistic backdrop, evoking a sense of urban decay and moral ambiguity. This serves as the perfect setting for the complex character dynamics that drive the story forward.

At the heart of The Dark Knight lies the conflict between the iconic hero Batman, portrayed with unparalleled gravitas by Christian Bale, and his enigmatic adversary, the Joker, brought to life in a chillingly mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger. Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary, as he embodies the chaotic nature of the character with an intensity and unpredictability that is both captivating and unnerving. Every scene featuring the Joker crackles with tension, as he challenges Batman's moral code and pushes him to his limits.

But The Dark Knight is not merely a showdown between hero and villain; it is a deep exploration of the nature of heroism, justice, and the human psyche. The film delves into complex themes such as morality, sacrifice, and the blurred line between good and evil. Batman, burdened by the weight of his crusade against crime, must confront the darker aspects of his own identity as he battles against the Joker's nihilistic worldview.

One of the most compelling aspects of The Dark Knight is its examination of the concept of chaos versus order. The Joker represents pure chaos, an agent of anarchy who seeks to disrupt the established order and expose the hypocrisy of society. In contrast, Batman embodies the ideal of order and justice, striving to uphold a sense of morality and stability in the face of chaos. The dynamic between these two opposing forces drives much of the film's narrative tension, culminating in a series of gripping confrontations that challenge both characters on a fundamental level.

Beyond its thematic depth, The Dark Knight also excels in its technical craftsmanship. Nolan's direction is masterful, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and suspense. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and adrenaline-fueled, showcasing Batman's prowess as a formidable crimefighter. The film's visual effects are seamlessly integrated, immersing viewers in the dark and brooding atmosphere of Gotham City.

Furthermore, The Dark Knight boasts a stellar supporting cast, including standout performances from Aaron Eckhart as the idealistic district attorney Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as the steadfast Commissioner Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as the wise and resourceful Lucius Fox. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their respective roles, adding layers of complexity to the film's ensemble cast.

As a fan of The Dark Knight, I am continually impressed by its enduring legacy and cultural impact. More than a decade after its release, the film remains a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Its themes of heroism, sacrifice, and the struggle for justice are as relevant today as they were upon its initial release.

In conclusion, The Dark Knight stands as a shining example of cinematic excellence, a film that transcends the confines of its genre to deliver a powerful and thought-provoking experience. From its gripping storyline to its unforgettable performances, Christopher Nolan's masterpiece is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of the superhero mythos. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the world of Gotham City, The Dark Knight is essential viewing for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking."
"""The Dark Knight"" is, without a doubt, a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre. Christopher Nolan's second installment in the Batman trilogy takes everything that made ""Batman Begins"" great and cranks it up to an entirely new level.

First and foremost, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of legendary. His performance is haunting, mesmerizing, and unforgettable. Ledger's Joker is a chaotic force of nature, and his ability to channel the character's madness is truly remarkable. It's a performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Batman, bringing depth and complexity to the role. The film's exploration of Batman's moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between heroism and vigilantism add a layer of sophistication to the character.

The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, all deliver outstanding performances that contribute to the film's overall brilliance.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart from other superhero movies is its gritty and realistic portrayal of Gotham City. Nolan's direction and use of practical effects create a visually stunning and immersive world that feels tangible and lived-in.

The film's themes of chaos, morality, and the consequences of one's actions are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters make for a compelling and complex story that keeps you engaged from start to finish.

Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score is pulse-pounding and adds to the tension and excitement of the film's action sequences.

""The Dark Knight"" is more than just a superhero movie; it's a dark and gripping crime drama that explores the darkest corners of the human psyche. It's a film that challenges the audience to think and leaves a lasting impact. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this cinematic masterpiece."
"The Dark Knight is a trilogy movie that I watch and re watch a lot of times. Full of action, great cinematography, amazing pacing on the editing side and storytelling wise is just flawless. I can say that my favorite of the 3 is the second one with Joker, just amazing.

For me the best Batman out there."
After seeing the dark Knight thousand time I think this movie is Great it's been more than 10 years was made this movie but until now I see how great it is not because how good is Heath Ledger in joker character but the action scene was really good and how they film it.
"""Batman: The Dark Knight"" is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the superhero genre and stands as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this film is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's portrayal of the iconic villain is nothing short of mesmerizing. He completely disappears into the character, delivering a chilling and unforgettable performance. Ledger's Joker is chaotic, unpredictable, and utterly compelling. His every scene is a masterclass in acting, and it's no surprise that he posthumously won an Academy Award for his role.

Christian Bale continues to excel as Bruce Wayne/Batman. His brooding intensity and unwavering commitment to the role make him one of the most compelling Batman interpretations to date. Bale's dedication to his craft is evident in every scene, and he brings a complex depth to the character.

Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent/Two-Face is another standout performance. His transformation from a principled district attorney to a vengeful and disfigured villain is handled with nuance and skill. It's a tragic arc that adds emotional weight to the film.

The film's screenplay, penned by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, is a triumph of storytelling. It weaves together multiple plot threads, themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish. The dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, and the pacing is impeccable."
Acting is perfect! Storyline is fantastic! Overall an incredible instalment in the Batman trilogy!
"This Batman installment isn't a bad one it's just been completely overrated since the passing of Heath Ledger. Secondly there was way too much material to be packed into the three hours alloted. If anyone knows anything about the back story of Harvey Dent/Two Face they are just left feeling empty and the character itself unjustified. I understand Nolan was trying to do something different with the Joker, but why disrespect Two Face? Also, there was really no Batman/Bruce Wayne complex which I enjoy and feel is important to every Batman film. Overall a good action film, but will not be adding to my Batman movie collection. Hopefully Nolan brings back Two Face in the next film and gives him a face."
"Where do I even begin. First of all this movie has the best plot and the best characters in cinema history. Heath Ledger performance as the Joker was one of the best perfomances that we have ever seen and the plot was well paced and intressting.

Nolan never disapoints and this movie was perfectly shot and the action scenes where so intense. We got the best angles and the feelings that emerged from watching this movie gave me goosebumps!

This is literally the best movie out there and a person needs to have this movie in his or hers watchlist. Seriously this is a movie where you dont even think about checking the time on your phone because you are literally soooo invested in the story."
"I believe this is one of of the greatest films of all time, I know that people won't have the same opinion or view as me but I fail to find anything wrong with the film other than I wish it was longer and it just didn't have to end"
Outstanding academic essay for scholars and they are you from the
"I have seen the Dark Knight multiple times but still love to see it sometimes when i got nothing to do. The movie is still powerfull and full of suprises. The story line is very good; it has multiple stories that are bend togheter in different stages of the movie. That makes the movie atrractive to watch even if you already have seen it.

There is plenty of action with nice realistic combat scenes. The evil Joker is a solid opponent versus batman. I liked the psychological deepness that is showed in different stages inside the story. That makes the movie als interesting for more intelligent people.

Besides batman and the joker, there are three other major roles. You can almost choose witch character you like the most. But watch out; it can be devastating for you in the end!

All by all a solid 10. You wont see movies like this much these days."
Not perfect but too good! Definitely the best superhero movie made till now.
"This is the Best Superhero movie I've ever seen. It even introduced me to Christopher Nolan and thus I watched Inception and Interstellar, two of the best stories I've ever seen. And also, Christian Bale, his performance is most definitely the best Dark Knight performance out there."
"Every character's story is perfectly told in one of Nolan's greatest films ever made. The actors were perfectly cast to one of the greatest set of characters. Heath ledger's performance as the Joker is one of a kind and shows he was born to play the infamous role. Christian Bale does a fantastic job in his continuation to play the caped crusader.

The film successfully tells the story of every character from Harvey Dent to the Joker

There won't be another film like it. 10/10."
"Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.

But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking ""but that wouldn't happen"".... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.

The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....

I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.

Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.

Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.

Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum."
This is by far the most over rated film of all time it dose not deserve a place on the top 10 list in my opinion not even the top 100
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that transcends the superhero genre, delivering a dark and immersive experience that is nothing short of spectacular. From its gripping storyline to its impeccable cast, every element of this film contributes to its status as a modern masterpiece.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is iconic, a chilling and mesmerizing performance that stands as one of the greatest in cinematic history. Ledger's ability to embody the chaotic nature of the character brings an unparalleled depth to the film, making every scene with the Joker an edge-of-your-seat experience.

Christian Bale reprises his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and his performance is equally compelling. Bale's nuanced portrayal captures the internal struggles of a hero burdened by the weight of his mission, adding a layer of humanity to the iconic figure.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of brilliant, crafting a Gotham City that feels both gritty and grandiose. The film's pacing is relentless, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI enhances the film's realism, creating a Gotham that feels tangible and immersive.

The screenplay, co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, weaves a complex narrative that explores themes of morality, chaos, and the nature of heroism. The dialogue is sharp and thought-provoking, elevating the film beyond typical superhero fare.

Hans Zimmer's score is the heartbeat of ""The Dark Knight,"" intensifying every moment and contributing to the film's emotional depth. The iconic theme associated with the Joker adds an extra layer of unease, perfectly complementing Ledger's phenomenal performance.

In summary, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends its genre and stands as a testament to the artistic potential of superhero storytelling. Christopher Nolan's vision, combined with outstanding performances and technical prowess, has created a film that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest of its time."

"The Dark Knight's alleys covered in the shadow, needles and trash on the pavement and lunatic clown blowing up half of the city is all i was expecting from the film portraying Batman-Joker relationship. Heath Ledger's role is making me anxious and that's a proof of well played character. He is unpredictable, brutal and savage just mental. It may not be the Joker we know from the comics but for me its the best version of the Clown we ever saw on screen. Usage of the darkness and shadow is what others can.take example from. The movie has a good pace, there is a lot of action.going on but it isn't too much. It is a perfect balance between action and dialog which is hard to obtain. Overall it is definitelly the best Batman movie ever made."
"Love it. Every bit of it.

A top notch superhero movie, genuinely lost words so I had this in my thoughts for hour:

This movie wasn't supposed to be like this, far enough to deserves the good ratings because the intentions of this movie it's simply to fight Joker, the main villain.

But this one hits different with Nolan's vision that wanted to show us the real persona of whom the Dark Knight really is.

The messages that this movie have, really determine the true words that never told before that makes you truly appreciate Bruce Wayne as a person and Batman as a Dark Knight that Gotham needs.

Watched every DC's movies this week, this one is trully the greatest ever made."
Acting great story great one of the best jokers that the big screen has ever seen.
"Nollan brings us a Batman that is totally real and possible. Any thing happening in this movie is possible to happen of screen. Batman has no super powers (we all know), either do the villains. Batman is a man using technology and intelligence as a base for his skills. Every line in the movie is plausible. The casting is flawless, quite well selected in entire trilogy. Christian Bale show his chameleon skills going from Bruce to Batman as fast and certain as you can flip a coin. Tha usually romantic Aaron Eckheart, is also broken in two, and instead of switching from edges, he merge'em resulting in the only Harvey Two Face, in the cinema that could be taken seriously. Heath Leadger acting is one of the most amazing things you could see in your entire life. It makes you wonder: Jack Nicholson who? This is the kind of movie that plays on my screen every once in a while."
"This isn't just a fancy superhero movie...It's beyond that. It deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. Putting aside the plot and the taking, the performances of everyone involved in the movie are beyond excellence.

Christopher Nolan is as usual at his BEST. Nolan strikes with his Non- linear storytelling in his own style. We will be blown with his sublime work. This is definitely the sequel we deserved.

Christian Bale and Heath Ledger were phenomenal. The Joker has made evil look so good...! This is the first film I know where the Joker who plays a negative role had such a positive impact on the film."
"Seeing it rated as the third best movie of all time by IMDb voters, and ranking up huge box office, I thought I'd give it a swing.

I mostly wish I hadn't bothered. Like most super-hero movies nowadays, it's one gigantic battleship of a movie, weighed down by its humongous budget and massive running time. How many sub-plots do we need? How many conflicted characters, staring into the depths of their pompous souls? Visually - great. And the vfx crew have to be credited for some of the most seamless and impressive work ever done, on the city, the batmobile, the bat bike etc. Brilliant stuff.

But the story, the script, the pacing - all pretty blaah. Did I give a damn about any of the characters? Did I really care what was going to happen next? Nope. Did I actually know what was going on half the time, what with the various criminals, their money, the money laundering guy, the Joker, the various Police Departments (what the hell is ""County""?). No, no, no. Boring. I was actually looking at my watch.

The one intriguing episode in the film - with the ferries - is shoved in three quarters of the way through the film, and unceremoniously dumped once it has served its purpose in sticking other bits of the film together.

So, all in all, I wish I'd spent the time some other way."
"This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still can't say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldn't see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super hero's outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldn't even move properly in it,(heck, he couldn't even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????)

I'll tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood.

Sure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat.

Dark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasn't.

Disappointment? You betcha'a!

Long Live Jack Nicholson."
"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" isn't merely a superhero movie; it's a magnum opus that redefines the genre. At its core is Heath Ledger's haunting portrayal of the Joker, a character study that delves into the darkest corners of human psyche. Ledger's performance is a revelation, crafting a Joker that is simultaneously terrifying and captivating.

Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne is equally compelling, showcasing the internal struggle of a hero burdened by his sense of duty and the blurred line between justice and vengeance. The supporting cast, including Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman, deliver exceptional performances, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.

Nolan's direction is nothing short of genius, transforming Gotham City into a character itself-a gritty, sprawling urban landscape plagued by crime and corruption. The film's action sequences are meticulously choreographed, and the practical effects create a visceral sense of realism rarely seen in superhero films.

What sets ""The Dark Knight"" apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity and the choices that define us. The film raises profound questions about society, justice, and the nature of good and evil, challenging the audience's perceptions long after the credits roll. Hans Zimmer's score is the soul of the movie, underscoring the tension and emotion with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.

In conclusion, ""The Dark Knight"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences worldwide. Its exceptional performances, intricate storytelling, and thought-provoking themes elevate it to the realm of timeless classics. A film that lingers in the mind and demands multiple viewings, ""The Dark Knight"" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and remains an essential watch for anyone seeking profound cinematic experiences."
This movie is only great because of Joker and Nolan's direction. Otherwise its a childish movie to me with lots of weak characters. There are many flaws in it as a movie as well.like shawshank and godfather i saw it many times but couldnt appreciate it that much.its the 3rd best movie of all time. I mean really? Joker no doubt is absolutely brilliant and fairly deserved an oscar but what about the rest ? He alone carries this movie along and others look petty and naive characters before him. Symbolically there is a continuous fight between good and evil in this movie but its an old theme now..
"Christopher Nolan's dark knight is still one of the best superhero movies if not the best.I think this is the first movie that villain become more attracted by Fans more than the hero,he really gives the better class of criminal the movie needed. It is a good combination of good action and awesome storyline."
